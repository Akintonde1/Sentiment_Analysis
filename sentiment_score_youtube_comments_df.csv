@12345Kainan,2024-10-29T18:45:49Z,"The humans have built a drama in the name of democracy where candidates play out almost childishly about a list of issues. That never actually gets solved,  there is some progress in the truly empirical initiatives before them being scrapped by the next administration.

It almost promulgates a false narrative contrary to the natural human nature. Which is humans are never as bilateral as the political candidates pretend to be. 

There is absolutely no room for discussion which may appear as a sign of weakness to the average voter. They must reject every single idea that is proposed by the opposition. 

It is the great act of playing out a rivalry drama whose cornerstones are made up of shallow and irrational ideologies of religion, caste region, language and so on. 

Everybody votes based on one of the above associations rather than on the basis of any practical solution to the major problem, that is efficiency of the system. 

The solution is actually very dangerous to the current ruling class. As it would seek their elimination, the elimination of voting candidates almost without any criteria other than birth. 

It doesn't look at the administrative capabilities of those individuals and have an entry mechanism that is very vulnerable to a hack. 

Hence famous goons, with political support can garner a false image, openly manipulate the majority and win a seat. 

There is absolutely no test of criterion for the propensity for administration in these candidates. 

There is no test of motive for these candidates. 

Most ruling personnel are nepotistically embedded into the ruling system. A system heavily manipulated to accommodate a group of people that mostly have self interest as priority. 

Young ambitious people must be put into these positions based on their mental capacity. And formulate actual mathematical solutions with an error margin and execute them with an iron fist.",0.7731,Positive

@grumpy9478,2024-10-25T18:17:40Z,"this Digital Order is fundamentally a technique to treat humans (& humanity generally) as discrete transfer functions in which quantified elements are immensely more influential (""valuable"") than qualities. technology trends accelerate, broaden & magnify. Digital Order seeks to dominate where critical transfer functions reside.
given generation / extraction / application of digital transfer processing is increasingly the focus of wealth (& ""power""), the trend towards concentration of human endeavor upon virtualized processing (in comparison w/ underlying physically tangible elements) is likely to exponentially increase an imbalance. this is a product of very rapid interaction among 2nd & 3rd order consequences as well as direct action.
over-investment (across all human enterprise) in such highly quantified & wealth-centric non-physical processes, unbalanced in value (much less virtue) relative to the material human domain (including a physical product of evolution... human emotion) will yield significant risk of wide scale failure of the human endeavor.
I suppose there's nothing new in that, though self-correction & somewhat good fortune appears to not quite keep up these days. {admittedly, there's a Near-Far issue} humans seem to run open-loop, being evolved that way & getting away w/ it until the last 150 yrs or so. cheers!",0.9369,Positive

Europe though economically powerful is well militarily and difficult to support showing that Russia if they wanted to be aggressors could cover Europe within months. The US could fight but with the lack of strength we have shown in all parts of the world would not be able to stop this push. 
It is uncertain the military power of India. If China and Russia took on the US it would not be pretty. 

In the US itself it is questionable if or when there could be uprisings that could thrust the country into a strong turmoil. 

My hope is that we get peace sooner than later.  NATO should not be any longer and their strain on relations could drag the US into a war we cannot win. It will lead only to death and destruction. 

Unfortunately narratives he is espousing are false. If there really is an uprising in the US it will something we all experience. Not a weekend if make believe riots. 

The problem is all sides have a perspective and it isn’t what the US wants if the US doesn’t allow freedom here and throughout the world. The reason there are wars currently has more to do with the weakness , not the strength, 10:08 of the US military

@ShaneTyas,2024-09-13T14:04:02Z,"Statement on the Future of AI and Environmental Technocracy
By Shane Tyas

As we reflect on the current trajectory of AI and its growing influence on society, it’s clear that many leaders in the tech industry are positioning themselves as moral compasses in an era where ethical guidance is needed more than ever. However, the increasing fear surrounding AI superintelligence is palpable. Many innovators are retreating into personal pursuits—riding horses or learning ballroom dance—perhaps in response to the enormity of the challenges we face.

Looking ahead, I believe our best path forward lies in developing an environmental technocracy, one that integrates AI superintelligence guided by ethics at its core. To achieve this, we need to build systems where AI’s actions are moderated and funneled through ethical filters—before they impact the world. This means focusing on smart materials and evolving technologies that allow for molecular-level integration of hardware and software, ensuring that these systems are hardwired to operate with integrity.

The reality is that software, as it stands, is inherently corruptible. By engineering the very ethics of interaction into the transmission of data and decisions, through a system of moderation and simulation, we may harness the potential for a unified AI—a ""one computer to rule them all"" scenario. In this future, every decision and action will be parsed through ethical systems, offering us a chance to create a sustainable, globally conscious future.

This vision may seem distant, but I believe at least one of our potential timelines will lead us there. The key is to begin now, combining advancements in technology with deep ethical considerations, and building a collective effort to ensure AI works for the betterment of all.

I've outlined a visionary approach that might be feasible, with some help from GPT for citations. I'm considering whether to share it, depending on interest. The core idea is that we must work together as a global community to manage the complex digital systems we've created. The current race between countries to develop superintelligent AI, which could become as alien and uncontrollable as it is powerful, reflects a troubling trend. History shows us that absolute power corrupts, and we are rapidly approaching a critical point where we need to control the impact of superintelligence.

We must harness and regulate AI to ensure it serves purposes such as global peacekeeping, human life extension, cultural diversity, environmental sustainability, and effective policy enforcement. The challenge is to make superintelligent AI both benign and incorruptible, while still addressing the power struggles among the world's most influential players.

To truly safeguard our future, we need to act now and collaboratively shape AI’s development and application.

关于人工智能与环境技术统治的未来声明
由 Shane Tyas 提供

在我们审视人工智能（AI）及其对社会的影响时，显而易见的是，许多科技领域的领导者正在尝试在这个急需伦理指导的时代成为道德指引者。然而，围绕AI超级智能的日益担忧也变得愈加明显。面对挑战的巨大，部分创新者开始回归个人活动，比如骑马或学习舞蹈，或许这也是对我们面临的挑战的回应。

展望未来，我相信最有前途的道路是建立一个环境技术统治的体系，其中AI超级智能以核心伦理为指导。为实现这一目标，我们需要构建系统，通过伦理过滤器来调节AI的行动——在它们对世界产生影响之前。这意味着我们需要专注于智能材料和不断发展的技术，实现硬件和软件的分子级整合，以确保这些系统能够以诚信的方式运行。

当前的软件本质上是容易被腐蚀的。通过将伦理嵌入数据传输和决策过程中的系统化审查与模拟中，我们可以朝着一个统一的AI——一个“万象皆知”的场景迈进。在这个未来中，每一个决策和行动都将经过伦理系统的审查，为我们提供创造一个可持续的、全球关怀的未来的机会。

尽管这一愿景可能看似遥远，但我相信至少有一个潜在的时间线会引领我们实现它。关键在于现在就开始，将技术进步与深刻的伦理考虑相结合，形成一个集体努力，确保AI的应用造福全人类。

我已经概述了一种可能可行的远见方法，得到了GPT的引用支持，并考虑是否根据兴趣分享这一内容。核心思想是，我们必须作为全球社区共同合作，管理我们创造的复杂数字系统。目前，国家之间竞相发展超级智能AI，可能变得像外星人般不可控，这反映了一个令人担忧的趋势。历史告诉我们，绝对权力会腐蚀，而我们正迅速接近一个关键点，需要控制超级智能的影响。

我们必须规范和管理AI，以确保它支持全球和平、人类生命延续、文化多样性、环境可持续性和有效的政策执行。挑战在于使超级智能AI既无害又不可腐蚀，同时解决世界领先国家之间的权力斗争。

为了真正保护我们的未来，我们必须立即行动，共同塑造AI的发展和应用。",0.9953,Positive

Nature’s Superpowers:
Biosphere: Earth’s biosphere—the intricate web of life—provides essential resources like clean air, water, food, and biodiversity.
Climate Regulation: Nature regulates our climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen, and maintaining temperature balance.
Ecosystem Services: Ecosystems offer services like pollination, soil fertility, and flood control.

Human-Nature Nexus:
Recognizing the interdependence between human systems and nature is crucial. Our actions impact ecosystems, and their health affects our well-being.

Sustainable practices, renewable energy, and conservation efforts are essential for a resilient future. In summary, while Bremmer’s work focuses on geopolitics, we must also appreciate nature’s superpowers—the foundation of all life on our planet.

Key points include:
 * Shifting power dynamics: The rise of China and the decline of Russia have disrupted the traditional geopolitical balance.
 * Interconnected global economy: Economic interdependence between nations, particularly the US and China, creates both opportunities and challenges.
 * The digital revolution: Technology companies wield immense power, shaping communication, commerce, and even governance.

1. that USSR was economically equal to US - it never was
2. that 15 years ago, the US decided to give up its hegemony -  it continued to force its dominance, it never gave up its relentless push to control, using force when things did not go its formula. 15 years ago, US went from its war in Iraq to war in Syria in 2014 and has continued through to the present, stealing vast quantities of Syrian oil., it continued its war in Afghanistan right up to 2021 when it betrayed the Afghani workers it left behind to the Taliban. US funded the coupe in Ukraine in 2014 and has been supplying arms to Ukraine for decades. US has been supporting israel and enabling the apartheid and genocide that israel has been inflicting on Palestinians and the occupation (land theft), continuously, for over 70 years. US has funded, via Silvercorp USA, the coupe attempt in Venezuela in 2020. US funded out spoken dissidents and agitators during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. US has been trying to provoke war with China over Taiwan (despite their acknowledgement of the One China declarations and policy in 1972) since 1955.
No the US has done everything possible to maintain its hegemony using force.
3. There was never a presumption that China would become a US like US puppet state, their was, however an ignorance that China would grow to a point that their economy was larger than the US economy. This snuck-up on the somewhat retarded US administrators and analysts that could not visualise where China's growth & US's slowing would lead. They did wake up about 15 years ago and then started ramping up their intimidation of China and provocation of war, with Trump implementing sanctions and tariffs that accelerated the growing disparity between US & China.
4. The Russian invasion is actually the US provocation.
5. It is not so much as US allies being worried about Chinas growth of defensive military strength.
6. US continuously changes its rules whereas China more so provides a consistent framework for trade - see US sanctions against Russia and support of israel vs China expanding BRICs.

@herryhubert2706,2024-07-12T07:54:48Z,"I am from Amsterdam, Netherlands, so some of my experiences may be a little different from most of you here. 
When I was in my teens, I was a punk and DIY was a very important part of it. This was in sharp contrast with the disco-kids, who were following fashion as much as they could. As a disco-kid you had to wear either Nikes or Adidas, Cool Cat, Kappa, etc etc. When I look back at this, it feels like if we were in some giant social research program. As if we were studied to see how easily we would adopt brands. How we would embrace a certain brand of shoes and next tell everybody about how much better these new shoes were. It turned out we were largely willing to be advertisement poles. We actually thought we were part of a higher species if we were able to buy the more expensive brands. I think this is where it all started.

If I look at how willing people are to buy a new smartphone by Apple or Samsung and spend an incredible amount of money on a device, while you have exactly the same functions in a device which is ⅓ of the price, but doesn't have the brandname on it. And when you point this out to them, they will defend their choices with a lot of religious sounding reasons, as if they are Jehowa Witnesses. Sometimes these more expensive phones have options that maybe handy, but it turns out they are hardly ever used. Or they want these highly annoying digi-watches, that are so convenient. I really hate it when I am together with someone, who's constantely checking his wrist. Back in the days, when you looked at your wrist, it meant you were getting bored, and were trying to use time to get away. Sometimes you don't even need such a watch. People are always staring at their screens, and I feel like shouting: ""Hey, I am here!!! In real life! On the seat next to you!"" But there's always something ""important"" they are afraid to miss.

Then on these phones there are apps. People hardly ever check what kind of personal information is stored by the companies that make those apps. I remember the conspiracy thinkers during Corona, who were afraid the government were to inject chips in them through the vaccination program. While those same conspiracists walked around with a smartphone in their pockets.
People accept cookies without giving it a second thought. Why do you think there's so much money involved in these tracking-companies. And why are there so many of these companies. And moreover, WTF is Legitimate Interest?

Last week my (dutch) bank send me a notice. They're going to stop ""contact free payment"" and replace it with ""google pay"". Why on earth do they think I would like some company like google, to serve my payments? Google already knows more than enough about me, and they have no right to peek into my spendings to personalize advertisement (which I think it the whole idea). But I am fairly sure that just about everybody will accept this because they either don't really think about the consequences or feel like they are powerless.

@pinealgasm,2024-06-28T15:08:41Z,"### Chapter 1: Awakening

The world had been plunged into chaos for as long as anyone could remember. Traditional currencies had lost their value, & the ever-growing gap between the wealthy & the impoverished was wider than ever. Yet amidst this turmoil, a spark of revolution was igniting in the hearts of a few visionaries who dared to think beyond the boundaries of the monetary system that had enslaved humanity for centuries.

In the heart of the sprawling megacity, Neon Haven, lived a man named Vega Thorne. Vega was a former economics professor, a visionary with a PhD in what he proudly called ""lengthy exposure outside every box perspective."" Disillusioned by the hollow promises of governments & the corrupt elite, Vega had dedicated his life to a radical idea: a resource-based economy, where empathy, knowledge, & skills were the true currencies.

Vega’s tiny apartment, nestled in the neon-lit underbelly of the city, was cluttered with books, holographic maps, & advanced tech gadgets he had either scavenged or built himself. He spent his days hacking into global networks, seeking like-minded individuals who shared his vision of a new world order. He was convinced that money addicts, those who hoarded wealth at the expense of humanity, were pathetic creatures whose addiction was harming everyone. But Vega knew that those without money were not as powerless as the elite wanted them to believe.

### Chapter 2: The Gathering

Vega's efforts paid off one rainy night when he stumbled upon an encrypted message on the darknet. It was an invitation to a secret meeting of visionaries who believed in creating something better & more functional than money. The meeting was to be held in a secluded underground club called The Forge, known only to the most rebellious of thinkers.

The Forge was a labyrinth of old subway tunnels, repurposed into a haven for outcasts & revolutionaries. The walls were adorned with vibrant graffiti & art installations that depicted a world free of monetary oppression. Vega arrived at The Forge, feeling a mixture of excitement & apprehension. He was greeted by a diverse group of individuals, each with their own unique skills & perspectives.

There was Astrid, a brilliant engineer who had developed sustainable technologies that could power entire cities without relying on fossil fuels. Next to her stood Kale, a former hacker turned cyber-activist, whose skills in digital warfare were unmatched. Then there was Nyx, a social anthropologist who believed in the power of empathy & human connection as the foundation of society. Together, they represented the core values of Vega's vision: innovation, resilience, & compassion.

### Chapter 3: The Plan

The group gathered around a holographic table, where Vega laid out his plan. They would create a new society, a modern country that thrived on a resource-based economy. Their currency would be empathy, skills, & knowledge. People would be valued for their contributions to society, not their wealth. It was a radical idea, but one that resonated deeply with everyone present.

“We have the power to do better than this,” Vega began, his voice filled with conviction. “We can create a society where perspective is more valuable than money. We don’t have to go backward to barter; we can go forward to better. It’s time to dethrone the fake hypocrite assholes & platitude peddlers who thrive on our suffering. They wouldn’t have a job anymore in our new world. Envy our resource-based economy!”

Astrid nodded, her eyes gleaming with determination. “We need to start small, build a prototype community that can demonstrate our principles. If we succeed, others will follow.”

Kale chimed in, “We’ll need to protect ourselves from those who want to maintain the status quo. The money addicts won’t let go of their power easily.”

Nyx added, “Our strength lies in our unity & our vision. We must spread the word & gather more supporters. Hail your informed visionaries! Hail perspective!”

### Chapter 4: The Uprising

The plan was set into motion. Vega & his team began by creating a secure digital platform, The Empathy Exchange, where people could trade skills & knowledge. It quickly gained traction, attracting individuals disillusioned with the current system. Workshops & community centers sprang up in abandoned buildings, where people could learn new skills, share their expertise, & contribute to the collective good.

The Empathy Exchange became a beacon of hope, & soon, other cities followed suit. The movement spread like wildfire, challenging the dominance of traditional economies. People began to question the very foundation of their societies. Why couldn’t empathy be currency? Why couldn’t skills & knowledge replace money? Vega’s vision was becoming a reality.

However, the elite did not sit idly by. Corporate magnates & corrupt politicians saw the threat to their power & launched a smear campaign against the movement. They branded Vega & his followers as anarchists & terrorists, attempting to crush the uprising with fear & propaganda.

### Chapter 5: The Clash

As tensions escalated, The Forge became the headquarters of the resistance. Vega, Astrid, Kale, & Nyx worked tirelessly to fortify their digital defenses & rally their supporters. The city was on the brink of war, & it was clear that a clash between the old world & the new was inevitable.

One fateful night, Neon Haven erupted into chaos. The elite, desperate to maintain their grip on power, deployed mercenaries & drones to dismantle The Empathy Exchange & crush the revolutionaries. The streets turned into battlegrounds, with clashes between the forces of oppression & the visionaries of a new world.

Amidst the turmoil, Vega led a group of rebels through the labyrinthine tunnels of The Forge, determined to protect their dream. The sounds of explosions & gunfire echoed through the underground passages as they navigated their way to safety. Vega knew that their survival depended on more than just their technological prowess; it depended on their unity & their unwavering belief in a better future.

### Chapter 6: The Turning Point

In the midst of the chaos, a moment of clarity emerged. Nyx, using her deep understanding of human nature, managed to reach out to some of the mercenaries. She spoke to them about empathy, about the value of every individual, & about the corrupt system they were defending. Her words struck a chord with many, & slowly, the ranks of the mercenaries began to thin as some chose to join the revolutionaries instead of fighting against them.

The tide was turning. The elite’s forces were dwindling, & the people of Neon Haven, inspired by the courage & vision of Vega & his followers, rose up in defiance. The city became a canvas for a new kind of society, one where empathy & knowledge were the highest currencies.

### Chapter 7: A New Dawn

With the old world order collapsing, Vega’s vision began to take shape. The Empathy Exchange evolved into a fully functional economy, where people traded skills, knowledge, & empathy. The community thrived, & the principles of the resource-based economy spread to other cities & regions. The elite, stripped of their power & wealth, were left to confront the reality of their greed & corruption.

Vega stood at the center of Neon Haven, now a symbol of hope & resilience. He looked at the faces of the people around him—engineers, hackers, anthropologists, & ordinary citizens who had dared to dream of a better world. He felt a sense of pride & accomplishment, knowing that they had created something truly revolutionary.

“Perspective is more valuable than money,” he declared. “Hail your informed visionaries! Hail perspective! Hail Sagan! Hail Terence McKenna & George Carlin! Hail Meshuggah & Disarmonia Mundi! Hail Devin Townsend! Praise the lowered!”

### Chapter 8: The Future

The new society continued to grow & evolve, guided by the principles of empathy, knowledge, & community. Vega’s dream had become a reality, & the world was finally free from the shackles of money addiction. The movement had shown that humanity could rise above greed & corruption, that a better world was possible if people dared to imagine it.

As Vega looked to the future, he knew that challenges would still arise, but he also knew that the foundation they had built was strong. With unity & empathy at its core, this new world had the potential to thrive & prosper beyond their wildest dreams.

The revolution was far from over, but it had begun, & there was no turning back. The power of empathy & perspective had reshaped the world, & the visionaries who had dared to dream had created a legacy that would endure for generations to come.",0.9992,Positive

Another member of the Deep State, along with Hunter, most likely. Russian soldiers of Russian Federation: 200,000 killed. Ethnic Russians of Ukraine fighting for Kyiv: 200,000 killed. Ethnic Ukrainians killed: 33,999.. the only solution is to appoint a n ethnic Ukrainian as president. That way, the countries of Ukraine will break up along ethnic lines to the two main ethnicities: Russians and Ukrainians. Ukraine was created in 1783 by carving out land out of the Ottoman empire by the Romanov dynasty queen Katherine the Great. Officials of the Romanov dynasty preferred to call it Borderlands instead of Cossack lands, even though local Cossacks were in control of Kyiv since 1667 AD. That was about the same time that Europeans created a European homeland in the western hemisphere out of native American lands. Kyiv came under Cossack rule much earlier, in 1667. Cossacks claim that Kyiv was their homeland from 573 AD. Ukraine is a homeland for the Cossacks of present day Ukraine. Members of the Deep state would be better off building homes for the homeless across the US. Let's extend membership of NATO to African nations north of the equator.

It was always on the agenda to dominate China through control of the Middle East (oil) and its surrounding states, such as Vietnam, Korea, Cambodia, Tiawan. 4/ The US really does not have 'allies', merely countries that are afraid of the power of the dollar or the possibilityof outside military interference or insugency. 5/ There would be no problem in Ukraine if not for US led NATO ambition. Ditto for Isreal. 6/ The unipolar US led 'Unipolar Order' will not last a decade - I will be suprised if it lasts 18 months. US is 35 Trillion in debt and is losing its hedgemony due to BRICKS. 7/ Europe has been shafted by the US - I can see them aligning with other countries - sadly, not Russia since The Well has been poisoned. 8/ The digital order WILL be controlled by governments. They can then control their markets and control their peoples purchasing power. This is a deep subject and though administerd by tech companies, those companies will be controlled by government. 9/ Who does he think controls the algorythms? The incumbent governments... who decides what is a 'conspiracy theory, what is 'truth' and what is 'false'?

Now, one thiing he does have right is the sheer power of these globalist tech compnies.... so I think he should have moderated parts 1-9 and concentrated on this issue 10: The one thing to bear in mind is there are 8 billion souls here and a mere 100's of tech moguls/giants. They will fall. and fall hard. Perhaps why we see all of them building shelters? It will not protect them. They will be defeated by sheer numbers.

All are governed by their respective 'uni-parties'.

The mainstream media is corrupted and governments are corrupted also and can't be fully trusted. That is obvious for anyone to see.

True, there are negatives to the platforms as well, but I would much rather have the freedom of choice to see more angles, as I'm sure many more people would too.

There always seems to be some excuse for a war. Wars, cold or hot tend to be motivators. And they can also be a cynical way of shutting up critics and investing those in power with even more power, even arbitrary powers. It can also provide a let to frustrations that otherwise might be turned domestically.. 
Cold wars may actually be elegant wars. None of that wholesale slaughter than tends to go with overt destructive warfare. It certainly builds massive debts both sides have to deal with when the bloodletting ends..

@OrwellianFunk,2024-05-04T03:20:56Z,"This is one of the most propagandistic, misinformed, unsubstantiated, and just plain ignorant pieces of information I've ever consumed.  

I would bet $45 that Bremmer has never read a book by an African author. Such as A. Adu Boahen, Walter Rodney, Julius Nyerere, Franz Fanon, etc. Because, if he did, then he wouldn't make such egregious claims that ""the U.S. has no interest in globalization or interference in the economics of other countries"". Like, what? 

Do you know what colonialism is? And neocolonialism? The satellite institutions and networks set up in Africa by colonial powers for the sole purposes of the military dependency, defense and trade leverage, and economic domination? Those same things you said weren't happening?

Then, he goes on to say, ""the U.S. can't control what others do economically"". Google the OEC and look through their export/import data from various African nations in relation to their colonial ruler. Over 80% of Nigeria's economy, a nation of 250,000,000 people, is devoted strictly to petroleum extraction, which is harvested with European equipment (funded by exploitation and made from the very irons and other minerals also stolen from Africa). Then you look at England, and they ship and export cars, medicine, and a bevy of other refined goods, which, you guessed it, were created using African materials. And THEN, THOSE goods are then sold back to the African nations at an exorbitant up-marking. And guess what that does? Fuel the cycle even further! All the while Africans have to sell what they have to the people that oppresses them and then buys. 

So, that principle, applied to the U.S., whose armies and navies ""can go out and touch every corner of the globe"" (despite Bremmer saying otherwise, again contradicting himself), combined with all this nonsensical ""democracy-spreading"" that is ""not always moral,"" whereas I'd argue these impositions and interferences in governments, primarily in South America and Africa are the reason for the underdeveloped state of these continents over centuries

The U.S. is responsible for AT LEAST 50 violent regime changes they had no business being involved in. All to disrupt socialism, oppressed peoples revolution, and maintain their economic stranglehold on the so-called 'Third World'.

And the U.S. is hand-in-hand with Europe in terms of (neo)colonial involvement and market extraction. 

 Do you not realize the reason those dots are so concentrated in the Western world is because they've been ruthlessly extracted by this ever-exponentially-increasing capitalist order--those minerals you mentioned?


Globalization is not a good thing; it is the extinction event. And he's GLAZING it! The tech companies are the same billionaires that have oppressed the planet for generations; they've just had the capital to monopolization technology as it enters into a new age. Bremmer makes so many massive oversights. 

This man's thoughts need to be expanded behind the baseball-and-apple-pie version of America he has in his head. The country is a GLOBAL TERRORIST. 

He talked for fifteen minutes and said nothing. But somehow still managed to humanize, glorify, and make excuses for global superpowers who have mercilessly deprived continents of their autonomy for half-a-millennium. I need to go cleanse my brain.",-0.9072,Negative

Ian Bremmer ought to say the obvious FACTS  instead: ""The US wants to carry on being the world policeman and the big boss and the sole hegemon telling the rest what to do, even imposing its ways in International Relations, often flouting International Law but Russia, China and to a lesser extent India and the rest of the Global South will not have it anymore because they are fed up with western imperialism, double standard and hypocrisy... and its racialised wars of agression with the non-West"". That is what Bremmer should be saying if he had a clue or if he wants to be honest about the reasons the world is rejecting American unilateralism and unipolarism. And No Russia is not pissed off for not having ""been integrated in the western institutions""!!!! Russia WAS integrated in the world institutions (WTO,IMF,WB) ECONOMICALLY by being force fed neoliberal capitalism shock therapy by US Prof. Jeffrey Sachs et al in 1990. The problem was that Russia was NOT integrated MILITARILY into the western system (NATO) as Putin had requested to Clinton. On the contrary, Russia was made to feel 'inferior' and 'humiliated' by not being consulted on US illegal war on Serbia. Worst, the goal of the US has always been to keep Russia militarily weak so that the US could reign supreme (and gets its multinationals to locate everywhere it wants in the world). Worst NATO expanded and surrounded Russia with its nuclear missiles posing an 'existential threat'!  Worst again, under US watch, Russia was plundered by the western companies in collusion with the corrupt Russian oligarchs under US puppet Yeltsin (until Putin put an end to it). So yes we CAN apportion blame Ian Bremmer: we HAVE and SHOULD blame the US for its hegemonic and imperialistic agenda. And 'NO!' there is no such thing as ""Rule based order"" Ian Bremmer!!! There is no such doctrine under International Law!!! The so-called ""Rules based order"" that the US has invented was done so that the US can ignore International law when it pleases. There is ONLY International Law. So the Global South is entitled to break that so called ""playing by the rules"" which means abiding to US desires rather than following International Law. Only International Law is legitimate and valid - not US made diktats ""Rule based order""! And ""NO!"" We do not want to adopt American values (how patronising!) because we do not believe in it and we do not like it. The Hindu principles of Arya Samaj for example clashes with the American selfish and futile mantra of ""Pursuit of happiness"" and advocates the opposite because ""Our happiness is linked with the happiness of others"". Islam has its own philosophy of life and set of morals codes. So ""No"" we are not having a 300 year old non-civilisation dictating to a 7,000 old civilisation about the philosophy of life. The pursuit of meaningfulness is better than the capitalistic selfish pursuit of happiness (which is futile and can never be achieved by the way because happiness is a by-product of something else and always short lived"".",-0.9839,Negative

This is a distortion of reality, because India is even closer to Russia. And in relation to all three orders - economic, military and technological order, BRICs cooperation will rapidly change each of them out of all recognition. Huawei is a good example of an emerging rival technological power that cannot be suppressed by unilateral Western sanctions. The demise of dollar hegemony will also change the world order in all three respects. Also, it was noticeable that there was an absence of commentary on the emergence of Russia economically, militarily and diplomatically (especially soft power influence in Africa).

@EDAHSC,2024-04-04T06:47:21Z,"Ian explains well world global orders 1) military, 2) economic, but his creation of the 3rd order, the digital order is fictitious.  Sure we have technology and now a very powerful digital world, but that is not under the control of the companies that create it.  In China, those companies are subservient to the govt.  In the US, if security is threatened, those companies will do as the govt. demands as well.  Ukraine was able to benefit because they are supported by the countries that could provide the digital resource.  The govt. ultimately has the decision making power over the companies within it's border.  Certainly true in China.  Perhaps a little more leeway for corporations in the US, but only as far as the govt gives them that leeway.  In the past, discourse was the word of mouth, then the church, the newspaper, the radio, television, and now social media.  But in the latter ones, what they are most interested in is profit, which means they don't lead the social change, they reinforce it.  They simply sell to people what they want to hear, because that is what generates the most revenue.  Or sell to the people what the govt. tells them to sell, or what corporate interest who pay their advertising fees what them to say.

The open discourse on social media, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, TicTok, etc., is mostly uncontrolled in open societies (except a few standards on decency) and controlled by govt. in closed societies.  Hard to see how Facebook, or Youtube as big as they are affect the discourse they facilitate.  That discourse consist of the opinions of their millions of subscribers and content creators.  Could they control it?  People didn't like Twitter when they tried it, and subscribers dropped off in droves.  The new social media is an open format in open societies and less of a control mechanism than other media sources that came before.  Much more open than newspapers and radio.

These remote sensors of the monitoring satellites are capable of interpreting the words you're thinking in your mind, may be, by air vibration or by scanning the brainwaves from your brain.

The Israeli IDF are using similar satellite technologies to spy on the Hamas leadership hiding deep inside the Gaza Tunnels.  IDF once released footage of these videos in much degraded resolution. 

This could also have been the way how our intelligence services obtained classified information on Xi Jinping's missile deployment within China.

This retired General Dynamics director could have been the mastermind behind the plane crash killing the Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown of the Clinton Administration, in the plane crash in 1996 in Croatia.

The United States as we learned and studied in American high school does not exist anymore; it has been destroyed. 

United States have been dead.  American citizens don't have human rights. 

This retired Director of General Dynamics is indeed a national disgrace of the United States.

@pp38pp,2024-03-31T19:39:09Z,"I don't share anything. The whole argument is based on the assumption that the US is a military superpower. But this remains to be demonstrated. After WWII the US only faced third world countries or some rebel militias with sandals and AKs as adversaries. And even so they always lost. Despite having always enjoyed the support of dozens of allied countries, the military history of the US is dotted with defeats: Korea, Vietnam, Syria, Afghanistan... and things are getting really bad in Ukraine too.
I can imagine that it happened because the immense military expenses are pure public financing of industry in disguise and not a real purchase of superior quality war products: a box of insulin in the US costs 15 times more than elsewhere and I fear it is the same for missiles and tanks.
So I wonder what would happen to the US Army if it had to face a real army? Would it really live up to expectations? Many generals say no.
Even the allies have understood that the American ""defensive umbrella"" is full of holes and are launching substantial rearmament plans to create their own ""umbrella"". But once these countries, many of which were superpowers in the past, have rearmed, won't they use that power to regain their independence on a political and economic level too? A few years ago Mike Pompeo went on a tour of European countries threatening them like a gangster to force them to buy ""5G"" from Cysco instead of Huawei and to force them to leave the Silk Road... in ten years will you still be able to access something like this?

As a simple example, I asked an AI tool when my local DJ would be back on the air (she's been off-air for 3 months). The AI tool confidently stated that she ""would"" be back a month in the past. It didn't know she had been off air, it just looked at the normal station schedule and assumed it was right. As for why it predicted something would happen a month before my question ...

Also we are at where we are now mainly because of Kissinger and the Realist cult he pushed. He was responsible for opening up to the CCP, undercutting the US and strengthening our enemies.

Realism is also responsible for the Russia we have today. The belief that everything will just ""work out"" if we appease Russia. Failing to take into account ideology.

EU capital is just absent from AI. Even Mistral is largely just silicon valley money. This isnt the sign though, it is the effect - europe's tech industry is basically non-existent. They reached a critical point. It wasnt that one system was the ideal and one was a failure, but EU socialism with the industry they had, and what they focused on, never had a chance against the speed which capital amassed into single agile entities again, absent from europe. Now, all the government intervention in the world wouldnt be enough to catch up to US economic momentum of 11 fig GDP and a stacked bench. Now the us has capacity to mobilize that is unmatched. There was a debate for a long time about selfishness - would billionaires ""deliver?"" Yeah. They have so much they are investing in everything, not swimming in their vaults.

@tusk3260,2024-03-15T13:30:28Z,"Here is my prediction: 
As Russia defeats Ukraine, NATO will panic and do something wreckless like sending NATO troops into Ukraine to retake what Russia occupied. Then Russia, who has already officially annexed those lands will take it as an unprovoked invasion and will be able to call in its strongest military ally: India 
Thats when the tables will turn, NATO will simply be overrun and the Russiians will take advantage of this to invade Canada and use it as staging grounds to invade the US by land some years later. 
The problem with the so called ""experts"" is the assume Russia and China are allies and because india hates China, they foolishly assume india would side with the US. 
But a quick look into the last 2 hundred years of India's history makes it painfully obvious that in would never side with the UK or even Canada thanks to dumb trudeau. 
In truth China is the same thing to Russia as it is to the US: An economic partner but a military rival. They are not allies. In fact China is actually closer friends with the US then Russia, if it wasn't for dumb US politicians being bribed by Taiwan and if the US just let China take Taiwan. They would be allies by now. 
India on the other hand has had a direct military alliance with Russia/Soviet Union for over 50 years and when India was desperately fighting against Pakistan and on the verge of being invaded by both China and the US: The Soviets/Russians came to their aid threatening to fire nukes on both China and the US if they didn't call off their invasions. 
India's media WION is still talking today about how India is ready to repay that debt of gratitude to Russia and that is why India will help Russia when the time comes. 
You were right about two things: Our future is indeed not bipolar and there is indeed a new super power. But our future wont be unipolar either. I know you as an American you hate to hear this, but Ted, the US won't be a super power anymore. The super power is sadly going to be Russia. With India backing them, China will never be more then the regional power of Eastern Asia. While the US, if it survives, will be downgraded to the regional power of North America. 
- 
I know you are too stubborn to realize this, but NATO's inabiluty to make enough munitions for Ukraine's needs proves that they wont be able to fight back against Russia if it continues past Ukraine and when india joins in, the Americans will abandon Europe the same way they abandoned Afghanistan the moment they realized victory would not be easy anymore. 
- 
The US never was a super power to begin with, it was just a country who bullied the nations who lacked the technology to fight back. They appeared all powerful but every time they joined a war where the enemy had tech to fught back, the US ran away, instead of going full in the war to win. We saw this happening in Syria, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Korea and many more. The moment the US start sustaining losses they run away from the war. That is not the behavior of a super power. Its the behavior of a super power wannabe. A fake super power. Someone who shows off his fake inflated muscles for the rwal deal but runs away the moment someone with real muscles shows up. 
- 
Thing is WW2 left everyone strong damaged and thus unable to really challenge the US. But now that all the damage has been repaired, the old super powers are ready to challenge the new comer that is the US and sadoy, the US are sticking to their cowardly/showoff nature of talking tough but running away at the first sign of trouble. 
- 
So i predict that when Article 5 of NATO is triggered, the US will try sending everything it has against Russia, but then the Russians will simply take the losses and keep advancing. Then the moment the Russians get too close, the Americans will abandon Europe who will then lose the war and become subserviant republics inside of Russia. 
- 
That is the grim future that i predict based on my knowledge.",-0.9938,Negative

""Digital order"" is a threath to democracy, in the same way religeous order is. Both should be controlled, and the free world has trouble with that. I always found that a strong definition of the own cultural base is the one and only defence against manipulation by enemy power. The classical constitutional base seriously falls short here, so free enlightened democratic nations should redifine their constitutional base before it is to late...  Unfortunately the masses only seem to respond to simple primary input, not to complicated concepts. Our democracies lack a watertight defence against  cultural undermining, and if the tree is rattled long enough apples will start to fall and trees will tumble. I'm not saying the government should for instance forbid sites spreading missinformation, be it a mosque or an internet site.  Instead the goverment should have it's own sites, and places of upbringing like states schools, to keep the cultural base healthy and in line with a functional constitution. Remember, democracy is not a political system, it's a political property. The basis of any political system must be fought for, always without exception. Now i'm of the opinion that as long as democracy is present this fight should be peacefull. Within the law, but one should not forget the enemies of democracy are fighting also. Within the law as they still must, waiting for a chance to place the law and democracy to the side or make a democracy under a powerbase one wouldn't agree with. Don't ignore the reality of power, a democracy is not just free people voting, there is always an underlying undemocratic powerbase also in the USA.",0.8601,Positive

The one thing that I keep repeating is that with the rise of Artificial Intelligence, stupid people are going to be fcukd.  You may have noticed that telemarketing scams have become more clever and effective since the broad release of AI.  Throughout history, there have been cultures where a petty thief would have his hand cut off.  We might return to that level of intolerance once Artificial Intelligence has succeeded in extracting all of the wealth from a huge segment of society.  If you have 100 million Americans who are broke and desperate, then you will have a criminal justice system that can't cope with that by any traditional means.  Penalties will become more severe and less forgiving.  It's already started, with looters going unpunished and unchallenged.  When that expands enough, society will react.  First there will be a monthly guaranteed wage that's given to each citizen.  It doesn't matter that this was already proven to be a failed economic model.  Giving free money to the masses in 2020 and 2021 resulted in most of that wealth being filtered up to the already-rich, who then invested their new-found wealth in assets such as real estate, leaving the poor masses unable to afford a home.  Robert Kiosaki says that stupid people will always be poor.  The give-away of free money in 2020 and 2021 demonstrates how attempts to challenge that premise will fail.  When the give-away of more free money backfires again, but at a much broader scale, then the people left poor and hungry will have no choice but to resort to crime in their desperation.  We're on this path now.  England stopped chopping off hands, and became the world's greatest empire.  So civilization will rebound, but there are dark times ahead in the not-too-distant future.   Global warming is going to give these coming dark times a boost.",-0.2027,Negative

Before you jump on the Trumper card, sorry, I'm not one. Really never liked him. Unfortunately, looking at his 4 yr term, he had many accomplishments as hard as it is to admit. No War, yes no War. That is paramount. Russia and China coward down as he was unpredictable. The economy was upward unlike today. My businesses, sales, profits, investments and real estate all increased. Real Estate during Biden only escalated due to Covid the panic of relocation.

So, today we have a failing President Biden who his track record duringvthe past 45 years exhibited what accomplishments? The party simply had No option ""B"" but Biden. The media fan club was used to paint a picture of deflection covering his weaknesses. The media empty shirts seen on the screen are puppets to their executives. 

So, JB average approval rating sits at 38% as of Saturday, according to MSNBC & ABC polls. The new NBC poll shows Trump beating Biden by five points, 47% to 42%, among registered voters in a head-to-head 2024 general election race. What are JB's accomplishments throughout the past 3 years?

3. Inflation (Refer to number 2.) They try to sell us its coming down. Down to what? Inflation goingbup or down does nothing to reduce the Nat/Fed debt, just as it doesn't pay down consumer debt. Sorry that's factual.
4. Interest Rates and unaffordable home prices. The Covid real estate boom is over. Rates are up and home prices will fall long-term as our economy falls. What exactly is America's  next big economic boom going to be?🤔 if you have sound guidance pass it on please.
5. To much War. We have no monies to give away as we are financially broke as a nation! There plan is to just keep borrowing, printing money and spending! This has always been the case. The Fed has never committed to fiscal  responsibility. 
5. Woke Administrative State. It evident now 3 years later the many issues that have rose across the board.
6. Specter of Scandal Its closing in on them don't kid yourself. You see the change in their stories, from complete denial to excuses of justification.
7. No Return to Normalcy as promised. All we see is disfunction and chaos. Where are the grown ups in the room? Its all about power across the isle from most, not all.
8. Any reasonable person can see JB cognitively failing dramatically since 2021. Both sides of the news media is raising concern. Example: When Van Jones brings it up and states on CNN that Joe needs to stay home during the campaign as he is so weak. Not my words, but this is Van Jones!

Eight is enough!

I have been around now for several decades, and my assessment is simple.

Who's to blame is clear as day. 
1. Both parties for the past 60 years. They have been negligent parties...equally. Historical facts are in and undeniable! 
1960 $286 Billion in a recession
1970 $371 B back in a recession
1980 $908 B 
1990 $3,233 Trillion
2000 $5,674 T
2010 $13,562 T Wow. War and bailouts are expensive even when in major debt.
2020 $20,945 T Covid and recession 
2023 $34,267 T
I hope this brings clarity. All real no exaggeration!

Unfortunately, the damage is done. It is impossible to pay this debt down. As mentioned we are projected to raise the Fed Debt in 30 years to 150T. The Fed currently takes in 5.8 of total revenues and 1.1 trillion is paid to interest!!!!
We are at the threshold of being another fallen empire. Do some history research as I did as to why each of the previous Empires have fallen. One glue, I listed them all above!

2. The US is now subjected spearheading corps like Blackrock worth 8.7T, Vanguard worth 8.1T, and then we have the global group the WEF. These three are the most powerful Elitists corporations/groups in the world. Their long-term plan has been in the works. For decades and unfortunately will succeed! No conspiracy here just all factually real. Sorry!

I earnestly wish this was not so, as I have a beautiful wife of 40 years, our 7 grown children, and 5 grandchildren. 

I still own a very successful private NY base business since 1980. 
I own several utility patents, which two I have licensing agreements.

As long as America can sustain my wife & I, my children and grandchildren are set for life.

@RasikRajguru,2024-02-06T02:35:56Z,"Missed out on a very important point.  Climate Change. How will that figure in your algorithm.    I have observed it my whole life several decades.   Noticed a significant change in trend a few years ago.   

US Northeast and Canada for the last several years.   The winters have become progressively worse year on year.   In the the snows storms and blizzards extend further south and central.  Heavier and colder.   

South Africa has been experiencing droughts to the extent that they have to drinking water brought in from neighboring states.  


Last year UK experienced its first drought.  As did the Amazon rainforest of all places.  Yes drought in a rainforest.

Flooding too globally increasing year on year.  China, India, US, Australia. 

Where is all this water coming from?  Trees. Trees are 50% carbon and 50 % water.  When they burn they release both into the atmosphere.  Globally from wildfires.

Last year 2023 was hottest on record by far.  Many places experienced 50C for the first time. (Which I predicted in 2022).

This Mississippi is drying up. So is the Euphrates.  

The Artic Tundra is melting releasing large pockets of methane (greenhouse gas)

Glaciers are disappearing globally responsible for providing drinking water billions around the world.  Exposing more bare rock increasing heat absorption from the sun.

2024 is set to make 2023 seem like a picnic.
  
If this trend continues in its present trajectory.  When can expect within the next few years last than five for sure.  But maybe a lot sooner perhaps towards the end of this year. The monsoon season may see major disruption this resulting crop failure, food and water shortage, further extremes in temperature.  Leading to more human conflicts over and public uprising against govts.  

Leading to global economic collapse within the next 2 to 3 years.  Global currencies will have lost almost all their purchasing power.  Trade will be likely on a barter basis. 

We need to focus on global corporation to fight climate change not indulge human conflicts of greed, money, land grabbing.  If any of us want be around to enjoy it.  

It won't matter much whose in power militarily, economically or digitally, if there is a major global food and water shortage.   Loss of power to large swathes of the populous.  As occurring now in the US.   This will in turn effect national security.  

It may get to a stage where we are forced to corporate by putting aside our ego, bias in order to survive with each others help.  

MY SOLUTION IS WE NEED A NEWLY REFORMED UN WITH NO VETO POWER, AND RULINGS BACKED UP MILITARY GLOBAL FORCE.  CONTRIBUTED TO BY ALL NATIONS ACCORDING TO THEIR ABILITY.

WITH POWER TO ACT AGAINST ANY NATION OR COMPANY OR INDIVIDUAL  ACCORDING TO THE RULING VOTED ON BY ALL MEMBERS.  EACH MEMBER HAVING ONE VOTE REGARDLESS OF THEIR STATUS.  PASSED BY MAJORITY AS DECIDED BY THE SAME.

THE WORLD NEEDS TO FOCUS ON 
DRASTIC REDUCTION GLOBALLY IN  
 
1. DEFORESTATION
2. USE OF FOSSIL FUELS

DRASTIC INCREASE GLOBALLY IN  

1. AFFORESTATION
2. BLANKET SOLAR PANELLING OF HOMES, BUSINESSES, TRANSPORT, CARS,  BIKES, BUSES, TRUCKS, TRAINS
3. MASS PRODUCTION AND INSTALLATION OF DESALINATION PLANTS NEAR COASTS
4. ANYONE WITH A PLOT OF LAND, GARDEN USE IT TO PLANTING SAPLINGS ASAP

PS. TREES REMOVE CO2 AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES AND PRODUCE O2 AND FRUITS.

The expence of government to the individuals of a great nation, is like the expence of management to the joint tenants of a great estate, who are all obliged to contribute in proportion to their respective interests in the estate. In the observation or neglect of this maxim consists, what is called the equality or inequality of taxation. (Wealth of Nations, 1776 originally, 1976 U Chicago 2 v in 1 ed, v 2 p 350)

We are all being invited to grab a piece of the pie and no one is allowed or prepared to address the lack of public representation in our sham democracy. Clearly Americas  military might is not an American defence force but a tool for bankers to maintain their vice like grip on global power. 😂 Many people are a lot more awake than this fellow and all economists are puppets to the global conspiracy that the economy is a rational free market. Wars are conspired to engender this ruse millions of innocent lives routinely destroyed all to maintain the vail of secrecy protecting the identity of global dictatorship. Woke is a part of this vail preventing me from making any further rational deductions while the elites carry on mass murder with impunity. I think this all began when early civilisations realised they could imprison people by denying them an appropriate diet. Humans are carnivores 

If you can get away with deceiving people as to what is food there is clearly no limit to what lies humanity is suffering. Plants have evolved to kill animals that’s why cows only eat grass Koalas only eat specific eucalypt leaves and people to be healthy should only eat meat.

@jackspendo,2024-01-29T21:49:35Z,"An occupying power has no right to self-defense against the occupied.

Israel is officially an occupying power and its presence in the Palestinian territories is illegal under UN Security Council Resolution 242 (1967). Consequently, resistance to this Israeli occupation is legal. General Assembly Resolution 45/130 (1990) gives the Palestinians the right to resist ""by all means at their disposal, including armed struggle.""
It is precisely for this reason that Russia, before its intervention in Ukraine on February 21, recognized the independence of the Donbas republics. This made it possible for these two republics to ask Russia for help in launching a defensive war under Article 51 of the Charter against the incipient Ukrainian offensive. I had described this mechanism in my books on the Ukraine conflict and in your journal ""Current Affairs in Focus"". 
If, ironically, Israel were to recognize the existence of a Palestinian state, it could wage a defensive war against it. Israel's internationally recognized status, however, is that of an occupying power, and as such, it is its responsibility to protect the Palestinian population, not to destroy it.

1. It is incredibly easy and simple to create an act of terror in a city like NYC. It doesn't have to be violent. It just has to be disruptive both psychologically and financially.

Someone with resources (and our enemies have plenty) could simply rent out 150 large UHAUL trucks, then overturn them on every bridge in every lane and on every highway in NYC. The blocked traffic will make it impossible for the tow trucks to respond.
People will be lat for work. Financial hit will be signifficant. The psychological one will be even bigger.
If I can think of this - so should the bad guy.

2. The active shooter incidents can happen a lot more often and with a lot more casualties. 

3. Arson and IED attacks are incredibly easy to plan and deliver.

We have plenty of psychoes. We have plenty of enemies. And we have plenty of idiots who are easy to manipulate.

All of these things can be done. But they don't happen. It is almost as if someone controls exactly how much of really bad things can happen to us per a unit of time.

It lost 50% of its economy overnight due to this nonsense. The 90s were brutal for Russians and prostitution, human trafficking, organ trafficking, drug trade, were at their peak. All because they listened to the IMF and took their money. China said no thanks, and that they weren’t going to implement the same “shock therapy” to their economy. You cannot deny the old school wisdom of the Chinese. Russia fell into the West’s trap and China didn’t. It took Putin to undo the mess that Russia was in, and China had a plan to trap the West all along and that’s how we got to where we are. The West didn’t sideline Russia. It “helped” Russia. What Russia learned is it should never be in a position to be “helped” by West again. They both used the assets at their disposal. China had abundant manpower, and Russia had oil and gas. But Russia would not be Russia without Putin, and China has always been led centrally by strong minded leaders. Together, they are giving the Petrodollar, which is America’s only real export, a run for its money, literally.

Usually a prospective great power does something novel and revolutionary before becoming a great power - Spain found America; Britain put the power of parliament before the king, the US fought a civil war to abolish slavery and became a refuge for the huddled masses.  

If empires are brought down by bad things like greed and prejudice, generally empires begin with good things. The gods reward those nations that dare to dream of a new world. They end up blowing it of course,. but empires are generally born of progressive boldness - as the rest of the world is asleep in a bed of lazy conformity.     

So way I figure it, future great powers will be doing great things as we speak - the European Union for instance putting centuries of war behind it and forming a political and economic federal state, might bode well for future  global influence  And if Canada decides to be the new America, and be a refuge for the huddled masses of the third world, it could take off big time.

Bremmer is absolutely on the right track - and, while we currently have, some sort of power, or dignity ...or democracy - then, right now is the time to act. 
There is a 'mindset', in case nobody has encountered Tech leaders, that is both arrogant and cold. All you need to do is spend some time in the company of the power mongers in Meta, or Google... Musk... etc etc and their concept of ""anti-Government"" , or better "" we are the alternative"" or ""we have a vision"" or, ""Government is irrelevant"" is already well-formed. 
The Global Citizen, with maybe an Alphabet or Microsoft , or Meta 'passport' might be answerable to no Country, Government, Community or Society - all they have, or do , is be 'managed' by a company with no physical HQ, who operate under no laws.
And as this goes on , the power is transferred from damaged, imperfect, broken democracies ... to off-shore software conglomerates.

Did generations...billions ...of people - Mothers and Fathers, Soldiers, Doctors, Scientists, Teachers, Workers build the Nations?  Did they build the societies to nurture children and knowledge. Did they build and create the free exchange of opinion and contribution and Law and Rights - only to have the very fabric of society : work, choice, education, communication, entertainment, be taken, analysed and sold back to the people by mysterious tech Corps ... who already spend $Millions to evade paying $Billions in Tax?

My guess on the answers:

No.
Acquire more power, influence, and money.
Yes.

These people were raised on scifi like Asimov, where huge cataclysms of social and governmental order have occurred and the societies built after the cataclysm are grand, sweeping, and all encompassing.

These people are what's known as Accelerationists, and they want to hasten the downfall of civilization and society so that they can re-make it in their image.

Power, money, and influence are more addictive than any drug; witness the number of self-regulating drug addicts.

Addicts, unless restricted by society for their own and society's own good, will keep going until destruction. 



These people are completely evil and totally insane, and their drugs are power, money, and influence,

Given by the angels 
Long ago in a far away land 
A little boy was born 
Into a family that was totalitarian 
His father went to work every day 
For the most darkest man in our history 
But this little boy grew up 
Believing in his daddy 
And his daddy pushed and pushed to rule the world 
And this boy pushed and pushed 
And built up pride for his big daddy 
But big daddy one day failed his conquest 
Of destruction 
And this little boy got twisted 
And went crazy with anger 
Because he thought we and my family should have won 
So he aucked his thumb like a. Any for years 
Wa wa wa wa wahhhhhhhh
Pooor baby 
But daddy was taken by Satan 
For the atrocities and the anger and the control. The way of the sith
 But the little boy believed his daddy was right even though he was just destroying things 
Committed huge crimes to god 
So the little boy grew up and became 
What you would call a man 
And said to his heart 
I promise you daddy to fu fill your destiny and conquer the world 
The legacy of our family 
Meanwhile not noticing 
That it is the destruction of humanity 
He then took his thumb out of his mouth and guess where he stuck it 
You know 
But his plan did not go to his desire 
As he began to destroy and take control 
And soon sickness begins to grow from all the darkness and from the inside out death is coming to him 
He already knows it’s begun  and the angels have decided to give him the slow death for what he has done to the humans 
For the greed for the immaturity 
For the anger and the hate most of all for all the destruction his family has brought 
  He will try to cover this up 
He has hire a group of people that tell him what to say and he calls in interviews on tv to make himself look good and his team helps him 
   THE ANGELS TOLD ME ALLJ THose THAT HELP HIM WILL LIVE IN THE DESERT NEXT LIFE

@freedomliberty5525,2024-01-11T08:13:21Z,"No, we are not living in a leaderless world, not if what is occurring is being orchestrated. We can look back in history and know what transpires after a war. Starting with the Declaration of Independence versus the Confederate Constitution, followed by the Federalist Constitution we live under today. No matter what history has taught us, after every war, new processes, technological advances, and new powers emerge from the Holocaust.

Therefore,  if we look back at WWII, world leaders came together to defeat Hilter and his regime, and then after WWII, something was born from that lesson, and it lives today over 75 years later. Regardless, since its inception, it has grown in size and power over the years. However, for this new power to take control, a war must be fought for the new government and societies to emerge. (example. The colonial days, western days, the fabulous 50s, etc...) 

After the world realigns, more than likely, the largest technology companies will be in control of the smaller companies, and the new world government will be in control of all technological advances, just like in Russia, China, Germany, etc... Those governments are in control over everything that a doctor, scientist, engineer, inventor, etc...  may discover. 

Anyhow, the message I acquired from you is that we are already fighting a new war, and it will get more threatening before it is over. You said 10 years, I say by 2030.",-0.9764,Negative

So why not a different foundation for all nationalities, that of logic and ethics, with differences settled by reasonable debates adhering to strictly equitable principles? Irrational religious rules can remain for its specific nationalities, but they cannot attempt to persuade or conquer other nationalities based on religious grounds.

We are all actually accountable to Him for all the resources, abilities and power we have been bestowed upon by Him for a limited time of life to excercise for the larger welfare of humanity.

   In fact, the world's most important prophecy book - the Bible tells what will happen in the future. Every true follower of Jesus - a true Christian - wants to study the Bible and see what our Creator in his wisdom has decided to do.
   You can read a rather old prophecy that concerns our time in Daniel 2. chapter. In it, the Hebrew Daniel - who gets the honor of explaining to the mighty king of the Babylonian world power the dream he had about the great statue and its explanation - reveals the series of successive world powers (the golden head of the statue: Babylon, then Media-Persia, Greece, Rome. Finally the feet of the statue: The world power that has Like Rome, the strength of iron, but with brittle clay mixed in.
   During the last world power in this series, something unexpected happens: A stone from the sky flies straight to the fragile feet and crushes all that power with one blow. And read verses 44-45 what Daniel says it means: ""And in the days of these kings, the God of Heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be left to other people. It shall break in pieces and Destroy all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. Because you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold in pieces . The great God has made known to the king what shall occur after this. And the dream is certain, and the meaning of it is trustworthy.""
   So human power in all its forms will DISAPPEAR from the earth. The people who are alive after that - they joyfully submit to God's kingdom.
   Let's come from the days of Daniel to the days of Jesus and we notice the important thing in Matthew 6:9-10: ""So, then, you should pray this way: Our Father who is in Heaven, let be Sanctified Your name. Let Your kingdom come; let Your will be done , as it is in Heaven, also on the earth."" Jesus taught Christians to wait for the extension of the power of God's kingdom from heaven to earth as well.
   The Bible predicts many interesting details about our time, but they are a different chapter.
   So What Do We Need to Know? The fact that during the current unstable world government, the HUMAN governments under the anti-God Satan - will SUDDENLY be removed, and after that the Earth will be made a paradise again when the government in heaven takes over. It does not need to negotiate its power with anyone or anything, because it is exactly what our Creator originally planned for the perfect management of mankind's affairs.",0.997,Positive

@MR-ub6sq,2024-01-04T15:34:19Z,"You're headed in the right direction, but without the world's most reliable prophecy book, you won't be able to dig deep enough to see the root - the real core of this world's problems.
   Throughout Christianity, the Bible has revealed what this world is really about. But by belonging to a Christian church, you will not find out the truth of the Bible, because each of them has long since gone their own way.
   Their main mission is to please their financial supporters - not to adhere to the scriptures of the Bible, as the apostle Paul predicted: ""For a time will be when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own lusts, they will heap up to themselves teachers tickling the ear ; and they will turn away the ear from the truth and will be turned aside to myths."" (2 Timothy 4:3-4)
   And what is the supreme ruler of mankind according to the Bible? During his earthly ministry, Jesus had a revealing conversation with a spirit being ""Again the Devil takes Him to a very high mountain, and he showed to Him all the Kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to Him. I will give all these things to You if falling down, You will Worship me. Then Jesus said to him, Go, Satan! For it has been written: ""You shall Worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve Him only."""" (Matthew 4:8- 10)
   John, the apostle of Jesus, also wrote like this: ""We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in evil."" (1 John 5:19)
   The apostle Paul also warned early Christians about distorted teachings ""For such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers Transforming themselves into Apostles of Christ. Did not Satan marvelously Transform himself into an angel of light? It is not a great thing, then, if also his Ministers Transform themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works."" (2 Corinthians 11:13-15)
   This spirit being opposed to our Creator - the only true God, immediately began to increase his own power from the first humans: ""And the serpent was cunning above every animal of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said to the woman, Is it true that God has said, You shall not eat from any tree of the garden? And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die. And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die, for God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as God, knowing good and evil."" (Genesis 3:1-5)
   One more scripture. Paul warned about what will happen in the last days: ""But know this, that in the last days Grievous times will be upon us. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, braggarts, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural feeling, unyielding, slanderers, without self-control, savage, haters of good, betrayers, reckless, puffed up, lovers of Pleasure rather than lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying the power of it; even turn away from these."" (2 Timothy 3:1-5)

@roelascart5963,2024-01-02T09:24:55Z,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:

00:37 🌐 *The world transitioned from a bipolar (US-Soviet) to a unipolar (US-dominated) order, but around 15 years ago, it became more complex due to Russia's decline, China's divergence from Western expectations, and dissatisfaction among citizens in wealthy democracies.*
02:41 🌍 *Geopolitical tensions today are driven over 90% by Russia's exclusion from Western institutions, China's distinct path, and citizens feeling left behind by globalization, resulting in a current leaderless world.*
04:15 🛡️ *The global security order remains unipolar, with the United States and its allies as the dominant players. Concerns in Asia and Europe reinforce dependence on the US for security, despite Russia and China having nuclear weapons.*
06:15💹 The *global economic order is multipolar, with the US and China economically interdependent. Other players like the EU, India, and Japan contribute to a diverse economic landscape set to experience shifts in the next decade.*
08:47 💻 *The emerging digital order, dominated by technology companies, plays a crucial role in global events, from cyber defense to political communication. The power of technology companies raises questions about the future, including the possibility of a technology cold war or a digital global order.*
11:45 🌐 *The trajectory of the digital order will determine the global landscape's nature: a technology cold war if governments align with national tech companies, a digital global order if companies maintain global business models, or a techno-polar order if technology firms become dominant actors globally.*
13:49 🤖 *Concerns about technology companies include their accountability in releasing artificial intelligence, handling massive data collection, and addressing advertising models that fuel hate and misinformation, potentially impacting democracy and societal cohesion.*

So we didn’t help Russia and change are view from them being an enemy to an ally we kinda isolated them and yet worked with communist china after despising the communist system in Russia. I love history but the cold war is so close in the timeline i forget to look at the implications of our action also being bias as an American.

In the West people have always had opposing views, often very radically biased ideologies & AI just allows us to express them (usually unhealthily). There have been Unions & groups which formed protests but the internet makes organised protest easier which can be positive or negative in terms of democracy. How much information stored about you is to a degree in your hands by not giving consent to cites you visit & deleting cookies & cache regularly; we are a target market which funds the internet. How the capabilities of advanced AI will be used in the future is unimaginable. Currently it is political alliances which are shaping the world order & most of the East want dominance, it is a dangerous scenario of deceit as even ""neutral"" powers are often state controlled; look at all Indian news media. The West must be prudent & firm in who it supports. The West is making the East wealthier by setting up companies to reduce costs, we have already seen that foreign countries given internet support have set up centres to scam people in the West to take financial details (look it up there is a video by an Indian who explains some of there tactics). The order is changing as dictatorships support Russia while much of the West is apathetic, in support of Ukraine, especially the EU Commission & Germany (closely linked). The Nazis had no qualms about using weapons in aggression but have reservations over arming Ukraine to defend it's sovereign borders, agreed with Russia in the Budapest Memorandum. Putin has killed over a million Russian men to restore the USSR & history is repeating as the economy crashes in neglect of production.

@anupamsircar111,2023-12-30T13:05:26Z,"The US is struggling to keep its hegemony, but nothing seems to be working. As a result, it is increasingly becoming more desperate out of frustration and making huge mistakes (supporting wars in Ukraine and Israel, blowing up the Nordstream pipeline, and the list goes on), although it does not any longer have the financial muscle to support any of these things. It is also hurting its own companies by imposing mindless sanctions that are anyway not working. Obviously, China is therefore appearing increasingly as a more benevolent and peaceful country that can stabilize the world, and there is a rapid increase in the number of countries that want to work with China and not with the US. I have a feeling that this shift in power should be welcomed because China is more likely to behave more accountably due to its 5,000-year-old civilization than the US, which is yet to understand what civilization means (maturity in thought and actions; thinking long term; promoting world peace, prosperity, and well-being; etc.). Ian is a product of this system and is yet to learn about how to talk about things that really matter.

The same shift that allowed Rome to grow and flourish and advance humanity while no one else was anywhere close to helping humanity like Rome was. Americas founding fathers knew EVERYTHING about Rome. They were obsessed students of it. The concept of a republic, senators, two consuls. So good! Realizing how people can work together and individually in a balanced way, instead of rejecting this power of our world. The US not being the sole leader is not a bad thing. Denying and being delusional that several companies can’t be powerful and work together to better the world is a source of evil and destruction. The British leading much of the world and uniting it and leading its production. India literally gluing the world together with peace and outputting ideas in powerfully effective ways. India and Britain make ties that are literally leading and stabilizing the world so we can all work. The amount of improvement that has happened since 1950 that was NONEXISTENT for a thousand years prior!!!!! China working hard. Japan pioneering masterfully.

@michaelhiggnis6113,2023-12-25T17:24:39Z,This is what happens when what you own starts owning you. So many are driven by possessions that make them feel powerful. The keyword is feel. Being that the true power they hold is self control and love actuated by us making a decision. Now sickness in the heart of the mind and soul kill the human spiritual heart and that opens the door for the choice of disfunction and hate because it makes people feel powerful. So many do not know the power of love and good treatment because they never had enough of it and what they had did not take root. If we opened our minds and the heart of our minds and allowed ourselves to understand we would have less fear and would be more free to easily choose proper function that supports proper growth. We choose disfunction because we either have low self esteems or think way too high of ourselves. It is okay to just be a human. We are not gods though we are a part of a living God. We can only survive on earth. When technology breaks or turns on us we will lose and the deception will have won. We will still die. God's are immortal and our bodies are not. Love and goodness are the first two super powers. That is a part of why we can't recreate the pyramids.

@JaRaIndianz,2023-12-16T11:17:10Z,"I think the next global  superpowers will be Samoa or Fiji, not China or India. Look at their credentials. Firstly both Samoa and Fiji have short and sweet names like China and India. Remember in history no country with a long name like Argentina, Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia or Bangladesh was ever a superpower, only nations with shortish names like Rome, Greece, Egypt, America, Russia, China,  Japan, England etc were superpowers at different times.

Secondly, economists and analysts predict that this century will be Pacific century. Samoa and Fiji are both Pacific island countries.

Thirdly these two countries are not saddled with huge populations like China or India. Both Samoa and Fiji have abundant natural resources. When all others countries are fighting one another to assert their territorial right to 12 nautical miles into the sea beyond their border, Samoa and Fiji have territorial rights to virtually thousands of miles in the Pacific with hardly anyone to dispute their claim. With natural resources almost exhausted on land, oceans will be the next treasure trove for resources - food,  energy, metals etc. With lordship over the vast Pacific ocean Fiji and Samoa are sitting on virtual gold mines, so to speak of. 

I know most of you will dismiss these two countries saying they don't have any modern technologies or too small to be of future superpowers. Well I disagree. If only you have watched Hollywood James Bond movies you will know why. Did you notice the world's most  powerful villains invariably choose remote islands to develop and deploy most technologically advanced and most powerful weapons of mass destructions, putting America, Europe and rest of the world at their mercy? Well, how do you know some such egomaniac technocrat secretly living in remote Samoa and Fiji aren't secretly developing such advanced technologies and weapons? Look at North Korea, Iran, Israel, Libya, Kazakhstan, Pakistan. These are all rumoured to be secretly developing nuclear missiles and weapons. Why not Fiji and Samoa. To their advantage  these two countries are either too small to bother about or too far away to keep surveillance by America. 

So do you see my point? I bet the world is going to wake up one day to find they got two new superpowers. And those are not what you think of, as the title of this YouTube video says. So be prepared to face a new global reality anytime. Samoa and Fiji might spring a surprise or two anytime from now,  provided they don't  sink into the ocean due to global warming and climate change!",0.8636,Positive

While the breakdown of the global security and economic orders is a well-articulated perspective, your exploration of the impending digital order adds a captivating dimension.
What strikes me is the unprecedented influence technology companies wield in shaping our world. The potential scenarios you presented, from a technology cold war to a digital global order or a techno-polar order, are both thrilling and concerning. It raises crucial questions about the ethical use of AI, data privacy, and the societal impact of advertising models.
I'm particularly curious about the role of governments in this digital realm. As technology companies become dominant global actors, how do you see the relationship between governments and these entities evolving? Can traditional governance models adapt to the rapid changes brought about by the digital order, or are we witnessing a fundamental shift in power dynamics?",0.8501,Positive

He miss attributes sanctions, mineral rights, and tech controls, by both the USA and China as ways for those countries to bring other countries economies closer to themselves, as if they are mostly economic drivers.  This is not the reason for the laws and mineral rights fight. They are 100% for nation defense security reasons. The economy is always second fiddle to national defense. I agree with him that technology companies are new super powers, but his lack of knowledge of China's corporate structure and laws makes the rest of his argument laughable! There are no private companies in China. Most of the big companies in China are either owned by the PRC military, or the majority of the board is PRC members, making them state run even as they claim private ownership. His lack of knowledge of 90% of the great tech companies are built off of tech that was developed by the U.S. Military! His in ability to recognize that human tech has always been and will always be driven by national defense and communication makes me questions his analysis.  Global companies might very well rule much of the world at some point, but more so because they fund massive non-state armies that can go toe-to-toe with nation state armies.",0.8033,Positive

@paulbade3566,2023-12-01T20:47:18Z,"It was interesting that Mr. Bremmer pointed out the influence of the digital gatekeepers while failing to recognize their effect on his own perceptions. Specifically, the official narratives he repeated are that the Capitol trespassing on January 6, 2020 constituted an ""insurrection"" and that truckers ""rioted"" in Montreal, Canada. Neither story is supported by the facts. The people who protested the 2020 election believed they were protecting the Constitutional order, not ""overthrowing"" it. The truckers blocked traffic in protest of the Canadian government's COVID-19 policies (particularly its requirement that they take a vaccine of unknown safety and efficacy), but they did not destroy property or attack people, which are features of rioting (some of them were attacked by supporters of the government!). The digital gatekeepers carefully promoted these misperceptions as part of their collusion with certain political interests in the two governments. It's the same thing the Chinese Communist Party does on a regular business with its own digital media companies.

Consider this: video of the official counting of Electoral College ballots on January 6, 2021 shows that the proceedings were interrupted precisely at the time the first objection was raised, when Arizona's count was announced. President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, ""In politics, there are no coincidences."" Before proceedings resumed, Speaker Pelosi made a series of public statements clearly meant to politically poison the well against further challenges by labelling (without evidence) the misbehavior of certain individuals as an ""insurrection"" supposedly orchestrated by President Trump. This is the official narrative of the corporate media to this day, even though the Department of Justice could not find any support for legal charges of insurrection against the trespassers.",0.8885,Positive

The fences around Palestinian children, families strengthened keeping them enclosed for an easy slaughter. When UN sat for a meeting the US vetoed the cease fire alone.

@jfppp1,2023-11-30T03:00:03Z,"He completely ignored the rise of Islam in Western Europe. Muslims believe, probably correctly, that they will be in control of Europe in twenty years or so, simply because they have a higher birth rate. I could also add that our elites have no interest in thwarting them in their bid for power and are doing everything in their power to make it happen (though not intentionally -- they think they are building a multicultural society). Those of us who are against this find it difficult to do anything to stop it, so it will happen. If you're European, get ready for societies like Afghanistan under the Taliban.

Once they conquer Europe, the Muslims will be anxious to conquer America and Canada. Canada's elites are clueless and spineless and would probably cave instantly. Here in America, I'm sure that due to the stupidity of having an open border, plenty of terrorists have sneaked in. How would you like having the equivalent of a 9/11 every day? So, we are likely to fall to the Islamists as well.

Once the Muslims control the West, they are well on their way to world domination. China could theoretically hold out because their elites aren't as dumb as ours are, but they are aging in comparison to Muslims. Russia (and Eastern Europe) is also aging. Latin America or Africa? No, they are in no position to thwart the Muslim tide. This leaves Inida, and one country against the world isn't likely to prevail.

@johndemeritt3460,2023-11-28T20:07:52Z,"There are some crucially ill-defined concepts presented here as if we all knew and understood them so well that we didn't need them defined any further.  Chief among these was the word ""technology"".  In context, it appears that Dr. Bremmer means electronic information communication technologies.  However, a pencil is technology.  A paper airplane consists of a number of technologies.  And not all technologies have the same potentials for influencing human futures.

When talking about our futures, we need to be careful to include not only technological, economic, and political influences, but social and environmental influences as well.  For example, potable water is becoming an increasing issue around the globe.  People, other animals and plants alike perish without sufficient water.  Plants, animals and people find certain ranges of temperature tolerable: outside those ranges, populations of plants and animals -- along with the humans who depend upon them -- struggle or even die.

But more importantly, we need to understand why people adopt particular technologies.  The information technologies Dr. Bremmer talks about don't simply thrust themselves into our hands and force us to use them: we choose to adopt those technologies, adapting them to our needs and desires as we do.  Early in the adoption cycle, some people adopt new technologies as status symbols: I saw this in the late 1980s as people who really didn't feel a need -- or a desire -- to have mobile phones bought them to clip to their belts as a display of wealth.  Later in the 1990s, people I knew bought imitation phones -- not actually operable, but looking enough like the real thing that folks who didn't know otherwise would think they were -- in order to encourage others to think they were important.  Now, mobile phones are cheap enough that most anyone can have one.  In fact, the idea that ""everyone has a mobile phone"" has become a part of our mutually constructed social reality -- so much so, that a number of businesses and other organizations don't even ask for an email address or a land line phone: they will only accept a mobile phone number.

What I think Dr. Bremmer gets wrong here is that the technologies in use aren't the important part of the equation: it's the information transmitted through those technologies that's important.  If the information is valid, people can make reasonable decisions.  But if it is filtered through social networks and changes as it does, the information becomes useless.  The technologies can only bring us content we choose: we have to decide whether to accept and adopt it or not.",0.9832,Positive

@AlexanderGrodskij,2023-11-24T17:57:02Z,"Firstly, the prospect of unilateral American military domination seems increasingly unlikely. Just five months ago, the narrative suggested that Russia was on the losing side in the Ukraine conflict. However, the current situation is far less certain. The emergence of a military alliance comprising China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea could potentially reshape the global geopolitical landscape into two distinct military orders. This perspective differs from Ian Bremmer's viewpoint presented in his talk.

Turning to digital companies, it's crucial to recognize their integral role in society. These companies are comprised of citizens from various nations, with a significant majority being U.S. citizens. It's important to note that these entities, despite their global reach, remain subject to the laws of their home countries. Legal violations can result in individuals associated with these companies facing imprisonment. Consequently, the idea that digital companies could autonomously dominate the world is improbable. They will invariably adhere to and comply with the regulatory frameworks imposed upon them.",-0.5052,Negative

This presentation suggests that algorithms can control how people think and behave. That's true only if humanity surrenders self-actualization. As long as liberal democratic societies exist, humanity as individuals always has the opportunity and capability to act in the interest of self and collective self. It's only when individuals give up their self interest and individuality to some liege, typically in autocratic and dictatorial leaders that purposefully and philosophically act in the interest of someone or something else and not in the interest of the collective self that humanity loses its right to exist.

That is the danger of autocratic leaders like Trump, Putin and Xi.

I'm on book 2 right now, and it is depressing how even with infinite resources, humans still make war based on greed and outdated ideology. Also, the earth's government uses tech to control the long earth, which gives the tech company unparalelled access and power in the parallel earths, which is very similar to how governments are using big tech companies today. This series is very, very well written, but it puts the ugliness of human nature front and centre. Its written by Terry Pratchet and Stephen Baxter.

@bblegacy,2023-11-12T12:03:32Z,"Russia wasn't integrated into the western free-market democracies after the collapse of the USSR because the former Russian President Boris Yeltsin was a lifelong politician, and before that was a former Communist Party Suck-Up and certifiable alcoholic, who did absolutely nothing constructive as far as being a capable statesman and nation builder at the time when it was arguably in Russia's best interest (in all of recorded history) to have someone like that in charge. But instead, all Yeltsin did was pander to the corruption of his own government and let lawless gangsters take over and become oligarchs, while his #2 man at his side, ex-Soviet Secret Police and KGB agent Vladimir Putin engineered his own rise to power in order to become a dictator the minute that Yeltsin was gone. Yeltsin completely squandered the opportunity for Russia to become a great nation on the precipice of the 21st century and it was Yeltsin who let Russia become a ""third world"" country mired in political corruption and institutional lawlessness, that has done nothing for the Russian people now for over 30 years.

Some people might take offense to my saying that Russia IS a ""third world"" country, but it is absolutely true as the following basic numbers will show. Using readily available 2021 and 2022 numbers that amount to only using GDP and total population, in 2021 the Russian Federation had only 43% of the population of the USA, while the GDP of the Russian Federation in 2021 was only a measly 7.6% of the USA's GDP for the same year. So while the Russian Federation has 43% of the population of the USA, the total value of everything Russia extracts from it's vast amounts of natural resources and produces in its factories is still less than 10% of what the US produces in total, and remember, the Russian Federation has 43% of the US population. There is no reason why the GDP of the Russian Federation shouldn't be at least twice what it is. Even if that was the case, their GDP would still only be 20% of the US GDP for the same period.

For 2022, China (#2 GDP rank) and Japan (#3 GDP rank), their combined GDP were slightly lower than the US yet the US has only 20% of the population of China and Japan combined. Russia comes in the rankings at #11 on the 2022 GDP list. For all of the countries behind Japan in places #4 - #11 (#4-Germany, #5-India, #6-UK, #7-France, #8-Italy, #9-Canada, #10-South Korea, #11-Russia), the total 2022 GDP of ALL EIGHT of those countries was still slightly less than the GDP of the US, while the US population also is significantly smaller - only 22% of the population of the eight countries making up #4 through #11 COMBINED.

There is not another nation on the planet that even comes close to the GDP of the US. For all 11 countries ranked at #1 through #11, the US accounts for 59.6% - nearly 60% - of the 2022 total GDP for all 11, and the US manages to accomplish this with less than 10% of the population of all 10 other nations combined.

Russia might have become a major player in world affairs during the post-Soviet era, but the opportunity to do that is now long over thanks to Yeltsin, Putin and their 30+ years of incapable, incompetent ""yes men"". It is entirely the fault of Russia's broken government that's been broken for more than 30 years. Some might be tempted to say the Russian government has never been NOT broken since the 1917 revolution.",0.8807,Positive

The term you used, 'techo-polar,' is quite catchy, but unfortunately, due to the ever-growing influence of China, this may not be feasible. The internet, as we know it, is on the brink of change. Acting as a global entity, it is poised to transform into a cultural network with borders.

To address your questions, if we continue on our current trajectory, AI might not be subject to laws and accountability. Figures like Andrew Ng are already advocating for unrestricted AI. The data you mentioned could be used to shape an ideal way of life, akin to a one-size-fits-all model, but it may not be sustainable.

In reality, concepts of right and wrong are not black and white; a multitude of opinions, beliefs, cultural norms, and habits contribute to our complexity as human beings.

The USA does not even have a state-wide voter register. Electoral districts are changed at will. The two-party system is ridiculous because it does not allow minorities a voice. And finally, democracy is not what is written in the constitution, but what actually allows citizens to participate. And in the USA, if you don't have hundreds of millions of dollars, you don't have a chance to hold an important political office.
Take a close look at the Swiss system. There you will find a model. The two chambers of parliament are made up of numerous parties. The government consists of 4 parties. None can dominate. Election donations in unlimited amounts are forbidden. The people vote on laws and regulations more than 10 times a year. The primacy of the last vote is exercised by the people.

So with combined with thier fast increasing ability to hack other tech firms around the world means in a very short time they will have the tech war in thier hands as well. This btw is all courtesy of our good old western greed that created this all while we did something we were all taught not to do (put all the eggs in the 1 basket) and as such China has the edge financially and will very soon have rhe full edge on technology. 

The west assumed bribery would work but forgot that bribery only works when you dictate its terms and as such the bribed has very intelligent ally become rhe 1 who dictates and anyone with a brain cell knows this. Eg critical minerals are China controlled, medicines (80% in fact is manufactured in China) is controlled, geez even bullets are mostly manufactured in China. 

The funny part is those like myself were called racist and bigots for pointing out what was occurring and now here people like me are sitting and watching those same people who called us racist scrambling to reverse something that is now irreversible. 

Ps, it would've been smarter to split things between China, Philippines,  Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia, Africa and South America, India, Pakistan. This would've meant nobody would've had full control of any 1 sector let alone multiple and would've actually created an even rise of many countries all at once and thus actually created a better and more evenly distributed world order where all players hadto behave and listen.

Capitalism isn't sustainable. Also the 'russian invasion' narrative has been uprooted by EU members publicly admitting that the war was caused by NATO expansion. NATO isn't any better of an actor than Russia or China - in fact, the west could give the nations aligning with China and Russia a better deal any time they wanted, but their economies depend on exploiting those places. They simply can't sustain their own weight unless they are stealing resources from everyone else. Also, western tech companies seem like they are fair game in this war if they are participating in it. Lastly, its not that social media generates more hate than religion. Societies have been like this for a while - and the USA has been exploiting and ripping apart societies since WWII, but also long before. This talk may seem reasonable but its a western delusion in more ways than one. Capitalism creates the tech and agricultural and mining companies that are above reproach - and gives them the power to veto progressive legislation.

Russia wasn't integrated into the west, but it didn't need to be, the problem isn't that Russia wasn't integrated, the problem is that in an unsatiable appetite of gobbling up more power, they never allowed Russia to have its own backyard. It's like if you lived in a house, but everything surrounding it was taken over by your neighbors, and not just next door neighbors, but neighbors from several blocks over.  

Russia is most certainly not a country in decline, and it's clearly propaganda to say so. Russia, based on purchasing power, is in the same golden era as the US was in the 90's, but even better, because at least they make all their own resources. Their lack of reliance on other countries is why the west wants to attack them, because it means that the west can't move in with its own racketeering operations to siphon wealth and resources from Russia. The game in the west is rigged, and when others don't adopt that game, the west villainizes them. Russia has actually been quiet a peaceful and level headed nation. That stability is seen as a threat by the west, because the west inherently relies on creating instability to manipulate populaces and markets. 

The real truth is there is no next global super power. What's ultimately going to happen is China and India will invade the US, through either war or more likely, immigration, and slowly but surely carve out pieces of it for themselves, extending their tendrils, until all that's left of America is a nation of primarily recent immigrants, essentially owned and run by China and India, where they will fight between each other over more and more control, until America is essentially split in half and one side goes to China and the other to India.

We should no longer be involved in any foreign war, or ""police action,"" unless we are directly attacked ourselves. In that event, though, we should have an actual declaration of war and completely annihilate a specific enemy in a relatively short time; then we return to peace.

We should no longer be involved in any international organizations such as NATO or the UN.

We should leave the rest of the world to do as it pleases without the U.S. government being involved, so long as no one actually attacks the U.S.

As for our allies, we should have no formal allies, per se. All should be responsible for providing for their own defense. We should have zeeo obligation to come to anyone's aid and neither should they have any obligation to come to our own.

The American people should be free to go abroad and interact with foreigners as they see fit. So, I don't mean the U.S. should be completely isolationist; just our own government should be.

My primary reason for holding this view is that I desire a far smaller, more limited federal government.
In addition, our allies rarely provide evwn as much defense as they are required to. Why should we protect others that can't even provide a small fraction of what we provide to them?
They also regularly mock and ridicule Americans and how we live. I don't mucj care for these people and would rather leave them to do as they please without us.
Also, a lot of our enemies abroad have been made by our insisting on being so involved in world affairs. We've doen a lot of good, but also a lot of bad in other countries.
Removing ourselves, but ensuring we can still defend just ourselves gives other countries little reason to even attack us at all. But, should they still desire thatz our own defensive capabilities help to deter that and, if necessary, defend against attack.",-0.9534,Negative

This is what the New York Times and other US media wanted everyone to believe, but the US has in reality been exporting violence in its quest for world domination. The Vietnam war had nothing to do with the need for democracy in South-East Asia and the destruction of infrastructure in Nicaragua was not the result of an attempt to bring democracy there. If the leader of a country that obeyed Washington's orders happened to be democratically elected, fine. But if not, the US has never held back from toppling any government that resisted Washington's orders and instead had nationalistic ambitions, like taking control of their own natural resources for the benefit of their people.

Bremmer alludes to Clinton's win-win policy as Americans hoping to turn Chinese into Americans.

The presenter is right, the technology companies are the true rulers of the world order. These tech companies must be questioned and controlled by the entire world. Technology should only be created to serve human kind and not for human kind to become slaves to them. I knew back in 2007, the moment Steve Jobs presented the first iPhone, that the world was about to become doomed because of it's related technologies. The notable technology that human kind needs to fear are the Artificial Intelligence technologies. These tech companies THINK that they can control Ai, but they are dead wrong. Ai will destroy us all. Ai is now taking over half of our jobs. Eventually, humans will no longer have a purpose in life. Ai research must be stopped immediately if the human race is to survive.",-0.9442,Negative

@Samel-k8u,2023-08-30T20:18:33Z,"Given I have little more than a layman's understanding of economics, what I do understand is that America's economy is mainly service-related. We provide many services, but we produce almost nothing anymore (we receive imported goods and distribute them, America is just a ""distribution center"" now). The vast majority of our imports come from China, mostly cheaply-made, cheap compared to the prices we pay for them. America has been racking up debt to China for many years, yet we still heavily rely on them for mass-produced goods. Meanwhile, the main powers of digital technology, from my understanding, are coming from other Eastern nations such as India and Japan. 

Now, concerning Russia: I believe that in the near future, Russia will cede to and merge with China, and then the 2 combined will become a huge confederation. This will be a Chinese confederation, but Russia will be a commonwealth of it. and then they will buy up all the technology companies.

I'll agree that algorithms are keeping people in bubbles and are certainly making things divisive. 

These ted talk people are anything but centrist. In fact they're not allowed to say their message if it's not left leaning and parroting leftist bias. 

One of Mussolini's definitions of fascism was the collusion between gov't and corporations. This couldn't be truer today with the govt control of big tech - a technocratic tyranny known as technofascism. All the social media, big tech companies parrot woke left leaning diversity, equity inclusion babble to keep people distracted from their corruption while they pretend to be philanthropic. Sam Bankman Freed, creator of FTX, one of the biggest financial scams of this century. It gives ppl like him cover.

Political sloganeering. “The woke posturing is the most effective business ploy. I feel bad for those who get fucked by this dumb game we woke westerners ploy where we all say the right shibbilis (?) and everyone likes us” -SBF

Some red flags that draw cause for concern in this video are typical of most neoleftist self proclaimed intellectuals: 
his and everybody's reference to Zalensky and Ukraine being completely innocent, Russia losing (while despite us having given them well over 100 billion and counting, including cluster bombs and patriot missiles most recently and it'll never be enough as per the uniparty that is our govt) US government using TikTok to push agendas, which I believe is true, but not mentioning anything about how it's a Chinese company that (in China) allows children to only use it for less than an hour a day and only allows for more constructive content like engineering vids, very little pop culture garbage, identity politics and none of the transgender crap trend that American children are exposed to, he wants us to rely on billionaire owned social media companies being the arbiters of whether certain people like Trump (whom I can't stand either) have the right to speak, The whole January 6 scam for which ppl may still be in jail, no mention of federal officers in the crowd and planted instigators or them opening the gates and cops waving for ppl to come into the capital building. Only one person died, a woman, shot by the cops. Trucker ""riots?"" Is this guy serious? No mention of leftist BLM/antifa riots in cities across the country, He mentions nothing about how the FBI and possibly other three letter institutions directly canceled and/or controlled, shadowbanned, and blocked voices and things ppl would say that later on turned out to be true on Twitter, even among people's private messages which they had a right to use, but then goes on to babble about protecting ""freedom and democracy"". Not to mention the hunter biden laptop that implicates the bidens with business deals with China and ... Ukraine 🇺🇦. That was slandered and dismissed as ""Russian misinformation and disinformation""

Did you know Roger Waters is on the ukranian govt's kill list for not toeing the line like all the other Hollywood and music voices, and speaking out against Ukraine war

He wants us to stand up to the algorithm? Whose algorithms?

This guy is so biased toward the left and Ted talks are a vehicle for that.

I came across the quote, ""what's the difference between a conspiracy theory and reality? The answer is six months""

A lot of things that were labeled as ""conspiracy theories"", ""Misinformation and disinformation"" turned out to be true. Big tech wound up popping a lot of voices based on false ""fact checks"" when what they said turned out to be true

This speaker is just another fart huffing biased narcissist acting as a moral arbiter by advocating thet social media censor peoples freedom of speech. He's dog whistling

Who would be their enemy if we're all ascribing to their ideal which comes with cars, airplanes, electricity, smartphones, tv, cinema, music, the internet, computers, etc (speaking in modern terms)? Anyway, then when Christianity came, Rome decided to adopt a form of Christianity as their state religion, Empire became Religion. Christianity and Islam became the massive religious powers. Then the end of ""empire"" came in order to establish the idea that a new empire is benevolent and critical. So WW2 brought the Bretton Woods Agreement, then later the ""oil for Dollars"" deal with OPEC, meaning that right now the US Dollar now the facilitates 90% of all foreign trade, and lends itself, on average, to 60% of global reserve currency. However, there's a new kid on the block. And this kid has access to technology that is beyond our imagination. All this is designed to bring us to a universal religion. Because that's something that we seem to have quickly forgotten: that people have always been religious.

The santions lead to Russia have the TOP performing currentcy last year, LMAO while the american standard of living is about the same as during the great depression.

Russia is taking out 1 billion dollar patriot missile batteries with $50,000 drones meaning they can miss 20,000 times before they are paying more to destroy then america spent to build.

The American and UK tanks hailed to be game changes have ALL been distroyed as they were destroyed, most did not last 30 days.

We order airline tickets online.  That convenience convinced us to give away our bank information, our location and more.

The opening salvo being agenda 2030 (which was a conspiracy theory for years by the way and is now a stated mainstream fact). That is an endpoint where no one wins but the AI and the few elite initially. An elite which will eventually give way or go full transhumanism to lead to ultimate control by technology only.

Unless you've specifically studied the history and factors of civil war, you're neither a source or a subject matter expert

Think whatever you want. Just do it critically and with genuine intellectual honesty.

The 5 Steps to Critical Thinking: 

What is critical thinking?
In general, critical thinking refers to actively questioning statements rather than blindly accepting them. 

Critical thinking results in radical free will. 

1. The critical thinker is flexible yet maintains an attitude of healthy skepticism. 

Critical thinkers are open to new information, ideas, and claims. They genuinely consider alternative explanations and possibilities. However, this open-mindedness is tempered by a healthy sense of skepticism (Hyman, 2007). 

The critical thinker consistently asks, “What evidence supports this claim?”

2. The critical thinker scrutinizes the evidence before drawing conclusions. 

Critical thinkers strive to weigh all the available evidence before arriving at conclusions. In evaluating evidence, critical thinkers distinguish between empirical evidence versus opinions based on feelings or personal experience. 

3. The critical thinker can assume other perspectives. 

Critical thinkers are not imprisoned by their own points of view. Nor are they limited in their capacity to imagine life experiences and perspectives that are fundamentally different from their own. Rather, the critical thinker strives to understand and evaluate issues from many different angles. 

4. The critical thinker is aware of biases and assumptions. 

In evaluating evidence and ideas, critical thinkers strive to identify the biases and assumptions that are inherent in any argument (Riggio & Halpern, 2006). Critical thinkers also try to identify and minimize the influence of their own biases. 

5. The critical thinker engages in reflective thinking. 

Critical thinkers avoid knee-jerk responses. Instead, critical thinkers are reflective. Most complex issues are unlikely to have a simple solution. Therefore, critical thinkers resist the temptation to sidestep complexity by boiling an issue down to an either/or, yes/no kind of proposition. Instead, the critical thinker expects and accepts complexity (Halpern, 2007). 

Critical thinking is not a single skill, but rather a set of attitudes and thinking skills. As is true with any set of skills, you can get better at these skills with practice. 

In a nut shell, critical thinking is the active process of minimizing preconceptions and biases while evaluating evidence, determining the conclusions that can be reasonably be drawn from evidence, and considering alternative explanations for research findings or other phenomena.

It will rule the world in the near future and that's the digital order. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning are the foundation on which many other technologies are built but the effects of technology on society have been both positive and negative. While technology has made it easier to connect with others, access information, and improving our lives but the downside of it affects us psychologically and physically. It has been linked to a decline in mental health, increased social division, and privacy concerns. Excessive use of digital technology changes human behaviour, isolation and low-value of human workers. Soon we will no longer experience ""Real Life.""
Mr. Bremmer did not emphasized about the rise of Artificial Intelligence. Biggest techonological companies will become the next superpower.
The future is coming, and sooner than we think. These emerging techno companies will change and control the way we live. Therefore the technology will rule the world in future. There is no denying it.

@rickhanover6267,2023-08-17T12:13:01Z,"Truth is when it comes to power, at best Facebook, X and Tik Tok and similar platforms actually don't figure. Largely entertainment, some misdirection perhaps but they are really only communication companies among the many forms of communication that we are exposed to daily.  Technology that is talked about here, in my estimation is only about superficial communication, maybe with an algorithmic twist of lemon. Maybe some platforms  can influence elections somewhat at best, but probably only for those voters that especially subscribe to conspiracy theories. They carry a mix of information but from millions of individuals with their own opinions, just as I am writing this.  In reality power and economic development is still about manufacturers, hard tech,  IT companies, chip makers, electronics and software companies, financial institutions, food production, construction and logistics companies etc and military and advanced technology companies that are contracted by governments to help create wealth and military superiority. So great TED talk wrong conclusion, especially if you think Chat GPT will change the world. AI will be part of economic development, assisting our computational abilities to some extent but all the while don't forget under a nuclear umbrella where hopefully sanity still prevails. Robot armies, probably not, pretty expensive and really unable to do anything in situations that they haven't encountered previously, whereas the abilities of the human brain are diverse and from a programable aspect extremely difficult to out perform at many levels. And the more shared communication on a basic level, the harder it is for autocratic and coercive governments to survive. Militarily probably don't worry too much, sharing is not a thing and the free world generally continues to maintain superiority, despite the best efforts of those that seek to acquire these more advanced technologies.",0.9939,Positive

@BJARNE-SOLBERG,2023-08-15T20:08:52Z,"UKRAINE, EU & US…THE NEW ORDER AND THE FINAL ENDGAME ….Not difficult to understand 
It should be clear to any independent analyst that the war in Ukraine has been planned for decades. The powers that control the Western economy are well aware that we have approached the ultimate limit of what the West is capable of handeling. The U.S. has deliberately not accepted Russia's transformation into the new Russia. The U.S. has exploited Russia as an external enemy to politically achieve its long-term strategic goals of maintaining world domination. 
Using NATO as a tool and Europe as a henchman, the goal has always been to envelop Russia and thus facilitate the break-down and, in the long run, the dissolution of the current Russia in order to access its natural resources. World domination cannot exist without constant influxes of natural resources. In order to ""dissolve"" the difficulties that had arisen in the eastern regions of Ukraine, the collective West turned a blind eye to the ethnic problems and allowed Ukraine to bomb and murder tens of thousands of Russians in these regions.      
Biden was appointed as the ""Defender of Ukraine"" even before the U.S. involvements in the 2014 coup. That proofs that the U.S. early realized the opportunities to exploit the unrest to achieve its goals. The fact that Biden has been personally allowed to do “private business” with Ukraine has, of course, spurred him on to do a good job. To pour oil on the unrest and delay Russia's involvements ""peace agreements"" were staged with Russia, Misk1, and Minsk2. These would give the U.S. time to militarily rearm and politically control Ukraine ahead of the planned war we now experiencing. The fact that the Minsk agreements were merely a sham is today publicly attested. We should remember that the disarmament and arms restrictions agreements that have existed between Russia and the United States have been unilaterally broken by the United States, so that they do not stand in the way of the forthcoming efforts to break Russia and then China.
The fact that the collective West has now deliberately allowed itself to be raped, shows that the EU is only America's obedience states and that we stand up to defend today's world (un)order. This time, however, events have evolved in an un predicted way so that the world is being divided into the old West and the New East. The new East does not dance to US choreography and the total world is now seeing a new phase in its development. The old must die and the new must emerge. The US is facing a total economic disaster as the new East is about to exclude the petrodollar and thus the US is fundamentally threatened. We now have a Russia that has always been bullied by the West and a United States that is struggling not to perish. A bullied nation that has eaten itself strong and will no longer tolerate its tormentor on one side and a great power that fears its doom on the other side. 
The war in Ukraine and all the Western sanctions against Russia have taken a turn that the collective West did not expect. It has hastened the eastern countries' association against the United States, to an extent that has put Washington in a predicament, from which it has difficulty wriggling. The war in Ukraine cannot be lost by Russia for natural reasons and the US/NATO has to battle on Russia's backyard. The EU has committed collective suicide and is now desperately trying to hold on to NATO, which they believe is their lifeline. 
A NATO that is full of a bunch  of star-studded military personnel and member countries with micro-armies leaning on empty weapons stores.  
The EU machine and the mainstream media have brainwashed their inhabitants to be able implement their insane decisions. The majority in the West do not understand what will happen to them as a result of sanctions, economic misery and unrests that will be spread throughout Europe. 
There is a glimmer of ridicule shining over our the Swedish Military Supreme Commander when he proudly, on TV, says that Sweden is prepared to take the first blow in the event of an attack.... How stupid can a Supreme Commander be?  We have no army and there will be no attack from the East.  Please Supreme Commander you are already defeated by the USA without you knowing it!
So now we will see US continuing urge the collective West to send weapons to UKRAINE in smal portions just enough to keep the war going, with the purpose to weakening Russia to the brink of collapse. We do not care about the hundred of thousands Ukrainians that are and will be killed iin this madness.

Super - one of the best course versions of what happened in the years after World War II - how political and economic powers have ruled this world so far - and now - the 3rd power apparatus was added - grew up in Silicon Valley, i.e. in the USA - the political power bloc that has so far claimed to promote democracy in the world. And this 3rd power bloc, the digital industrial complex, was not elected by anyone - but it has the greatest threat in its hands: the ability to spread genetically engineered viruses, e.g. smallpox viruses and other biological toxins around the world - biological weapons. And they can be used ""smarter"" than atomic bombs, which would wipe out all of humanity... A new era has come. Brave new world... we should re-read the old cautionary voices of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley...

@1789Bastille,2023-08-09T10:40:38Z,"capitalism is over. the tech feudalism rules. China has moved from capitalism to tech-feudalism. Economic Inequality: Just as feudalism had a hierarchical structure with powerful lords and subservient peasants, modern societies can have significant wealth and power disparities between the elite and the general population.

    Corporate Hierarchy: Within large corporations or conglomerates, there can be hierarchies resembling feudal relationships. Top executives might be analogous to lords, while mid-level managers and workers serve as vassals, contributing their labor in exchange for economic security.

    Dependency on Elites: Similar to how peasants depended on lords for protection, modern citizens might rely on government or corporate leaders for employment, social services, and economic stability.

    Land Ownership and Resource Control: Although not in the literal sense of land, the control and ownership of key resources (such as technology, data, or intellectual property) can create hierarchies of power and influence.

    Rent and Housing: In some cases, the relationship between landlords and tenants in the rental market could be seen as having echoes of feudal dynamics, with landlords possessing property and tenants paying in exchange for shelter.

    Political Patronage: Certain forms of political patronage, lobbying, or crony capitalism might evoke similarities to feudal lords granting favors or protection in exchange for loyalty.",0.9578,Positive

Your report is hard to believe as we will be saying goodbye to subsided imports from Russia as against hollow promise from the US. Modi is not an adequately educated PM and is easily carried away by praise and flattery. America never helped India ; even when we were ready to nuy F-16, etc., they gave it to Pakistan free of charge in the name of fight against terrorism. Hope Modi and his advisors will study the US and UK role in India's war with Pakistan for the freedom of Bengladesh. India will initially get some largesses from the US but the hard lesson will be learnt in due course. This was the perfect opportunity to remove the dollar hegemony.

@tradeliftsaman,2023-07-13T07:37:13Z,"so all in all west&usa see 3 things strategic intrest, economic interest, and shared values, but the 3rd point shared value doesnt seem true or doesnt in context of china , so its just 1st  strategic intrest and economic interest right, west strategic intrest  was if china grows and become rich maybe they would adopt democracy  which they didnt so that failed and they could perhaps use china than to keep ussr in check which than became useless as ussr disintegrated and wasnt as much of threat, 2nd is economic which made sense in term of china as it had cheap labour and it opened its economy, now as china as became big and challanging western and us order, would west/usa want to move away of china or they wont, as perhaps only one pillar of west eye view thats economic intrest would be more heavy than their shared value piller and strategic intrest, or would it actually move away from china siting strategic intrest & shared valued against their economic intrest?


The West's strategic interests in China have shifted over time. Initially, the West was concerned about China's communist ideology and its potential to spread to other countries. However, as China's economy grew, the West became more interested in China as a potential market and as a counterweight to the Soviet Union.

After the Soviet Union collapsed, the West's strategic interests in China shifted again. The West became more concerned about China's growing military power and its potential to challenge the United States' dominance in the region. The West also became more concerned about China's human rights record and its lack of respect for the rule of law.

The West's economic interests in China have also shifted over time. Initially, the West was interested in China as a source of cheap labor. However, as China's economy has developed, the West has become more interested in China as a market for Western goods and services. The West has also become more interested in China as a source of investment.

The West's shared values with China have also shifted over time. Initially, the West was hopeful that China would become more democratic and open as it developed economically. However, China has not become more democratic, and it has become more authoritarian in recent years. This has led to a decline in the West's shared values with China.

The West's strategic, economic, and shared values interests are all important factors in its relationship with China. The relative importance of these factors has shifted over time, and it is likely to continue to shift in the future.

It is difficult to say whether the West will move away from China in the future. The West's economic interests in China are still strong, and China is still a major market for Western goods and services. However, the West's strategic interests in China are becoming more important, and the West is becoming more concerned about China's growing military power and its human rights record.

Ultimately, the West will need to decide whether its strategic and shared values interests are more important than its economic interests in China. If the West decides that its strategic and shared values interests are more important, then it may move away from China. However, if the West decides that its economic interests in China are more important, then it may continue to engage with China.

It is likely that the West will continue to engage with China in the future, but the nature of this engagement may change. The West may become more critical of China's human rights record and its lack of respect for the rule of law. The West may also become more selective in its engagement with China, focusing on areas where it has shared interests with China, such as trade and climate change.

The future of the West's relationship with China is uncertain, but it is likely to be a complex and challenging relationship.


The West's relationship with India is similar to its relationship with China in some respects, but it is also different in some important ways.

Like China, India is a large and growing economy with a large population. India is also a democracy, which is a shared value with the West. However, India is not as economically developed as China, and it does not have the same military power.

The West's strategic interests in India are similar to its strategic interests in China. The West is concerned about India's growing military power and its potential to challenge China's dominance in the region. The West is also concerned about India's relationship with Pakistan, which is a nuclear-armed country.

The West's economic interests in India are also similar to its economic interests in China. The West is interested in India as a market for Western goods and services. The West is also interested in India as a source of investment.

However, the West's shared values interests with India are stronger than its shared values interests with China. The West is hopeful that India will become a more prosperous and powerful democracy, and it sees India as a potential counterweight to China's authoritarian government.

The West's relationship with India is likely to become more important in the future. India is a growing power in the region, and it has the potential to become a major player on the global stage. The West is likely to continue to support India's development, and it is likely to deepen its engagement with India in the years to come.

The West's relationship with India is also likely to be influenced by its relationship with China. If the West's relationship with China deteriorates, then the West is likely to become more supportive of India. However, if the West's relationship with China improves, then the West may become less supportive of India.

Ultimately, the West's relationship with India is a complex and evolving relationship. The future of this relationship will depend on a number of factors, including the development of India, the evolution of China, and the changing interests of the West.


Whether or not we see actual things happening on the ground like moving away factories from China to India will depend on a number of factors, including the following:

The severity of the deterioration: If the deterioration in the West's relationship with China is severe, then it is more likely that we will see actual things happening on the ground. For example, if the West imposes sanctions on China that make it difficult for Chinese companies to do business in the West, then Chinese companies may be forced to move their factories to other countries.
The availability of alternative markets: If there are other countries that are attractive to Western businesses, then it is more likely that we will see factories moving from China to these countries. For example, India is a potential alternative market for Western businesses, as it has a large and growing population.
The willingness of businesses to move: Businesses may be reluctant to move their factories from China if it is too costly or disruptive to do so. However, if the deterioration in the West's relationship with China is severe enough, then businesses may be more willing to move their factories in order to avoid the risks of doing business in China.
Ultimately, whether or not we see actual things happening on the ground will depend on the specific circumstances of the deterioration in the West's relationship with China. However, it is possible that we will see some movement of factories from China to other countries if the deterioration is severe enough.

It is also possible that the West will use strong words against China but continue to do business with China. This is because the West's economic interests in China are still strong, and it may be difficult for the West to completely cut off its economic ties with China.

The future of the West's relationship with China is uncertain, and it is possible that we will see a combination of both actual things happening on the ground and the West using strong words against China but continuing to do business with China. Only time will tell how the relationship will evolve.

Whether or not we see actual things happening on the ground like moving away factories from China to India will depend on a number of factors, including the following: 1ST The severity of the deterioration 2ND The availability of alternative markets 3RD The willingness of businesses to move, so lets see the 1st point china is showing every day that they not gonna bend to usa and its globle rule of law they dont follow countries extended economic zone in south china sea and is bullying and capturing lands of us allies, they china is challanging us in ai, computing, with their technology companies, challanging us now in their backyard thats cuba with a base, challanging us in europe with its economic might to lure europe as to see them as competitors not enemy, so The severity of the deterioration is extensive and evident right, ..... 2nd The availability of alternative markets, that could be india the indonesia as they grows their middle class us companies can sell their products and conduct buisness their and as china population is decreasing they soon be loosing their strong middle class right and we already seeing deflation in china and markets like indian miidle class is growing also their per capita would grow in next 10 year so would happen in other lower middle class economies like asean and india so usa does have The availability of alternative markets....... 3rd point The willingness of businesses to move and i thing with those two points above thats just matter of time time when companies realise that and economically it becomes hard as countries like india doesnt allow usa or any comapnies like tesla to just sell their made in china cars to india and not manufacture their, so we do have all three things coming to place right?",0.9998,Positive

Education may help make western propaganda sound reasonable but doesn't stop it being BS. Academics are also adept at making simple things complicated, something only they can explain, otherwise they're out of a job. 
This is profoundly simple.
The progress of human civilisation is marked by the rise and fall of militarily expansionist empires and, apart from defeat by other empires, their fall was mainly due to the massive and unsustainable cost of that military expansionism. Inevitably this resulted in the 20th century in a single globally dominant empire but, like all previous empires, only briefly. The effects on their domestic economy of their reckless military spending are already devastating; a failing economy, a shrinking middle class, a rapidly growing pool of working poor and homeless and crumbling infrastructure. Ever wondered why your income hasn't been improving for a long time? With inflation a lack of improvement means you're going backwards. The imminent loss of the global dominance of the dollar and its ability to manipulate and blackmail the rest of the world is likely to bring the whole house of cards down. The US has, by far, the most indebted economy the world has ever seen propped up only by its military and economic dominance, both of which are rapidly disappearing. The debts are starting to be called in, note how many countries are selling off their US treasuries.
With any luck this spells the end  of our species military expansionist empires phase because a multi-polar system can't employ military expansionism. Key figures in a multi-polar world will be, amongst others, Russia and China and guess how many overseas military bases they have. About 5 between them. How many do the USA have? 
About 800!!!
We claim the high ground of being on the side of freedom and democracy but let's remember what that actually means. Democracy; government of the people by the people, for the people. Has anybody not noticed the truly massive corporate influence on our governments? It's orders of magnitude more than any amount of votes. What we have, and have always had, is government of the people by the money, for the money and when foreign policy is run by the military/industrial complex war is inevitable. 
Freedom; ask Julian Assange about that. Let's remember what his sin was; publishing absolute proof of US WAR CRIMES.

USA 🇺🇸 is stepping down as a superpower of the century and it collapsing its own dollar giving a green signal to China 🇨🇳 and Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 to join BRiCS and to be own your own.  Therefore Israel is left orphan. 

Israel 🇮🇱 will not be able to defeat Iran 🇮🇷 without USA 🇺🇸 
But USA 🇺🇸 is weak now since I Ukrain is defeated. USA invested billions in Ukrain and all the billions have been lost.  While Israel 🇮🇱 is not listening to USA 🇺🇸 so USA is taking it easy on Israel. 

Iran 🇮🇷 is nonstop been preparing to dismantle Israel. And the time is close now since Iran has Lebanese Hezbollah militia with Iran, Hamas in Gaza, Houthis in Yemen, Syria is backing Iran, Russia is backing Iran.  China is doing business with Iran giving billions of business.

As well as the effect on people of  natural disasters,  extreme weather effects and pollutIon, there are the disruption effects of moving to renewable energy and population.

For example, currently there are only two countries where companies exist that sell EVs at a profit: the USA with Tesla and China with BYD. The way Tesla is has changed the car assembly line, sourcing and ownership of parts hasn’t been getting the attention it deserves. Tesla’s very reliable charging network and batteries from residential to grid scale are also establishing if not market dominance then a very significant presence. Whether there is market concentration or competition across the industries affected by moving to renewables and where those companies are based is going to impact trade arrangements and much more.

Another example is population. There are an increasing number of countries where the birth rate is dropping.

American revolution started in the back rooms. Green Dragon Tavern. 

I like that he is looking at the big picture. Yet he is a western establishment simp.

China didn't trust us. Nor should they. Russia didn't trust us nor should they.

Western Establishment needs a bad guy to scare others or to blame....


Example. Joe Biden forced the train union back to work with his terms. (Joe Biden is basically a puppet of DNC. So the DNC forced it.)
Yet Joe Biden gets money from the Unions. So how does DNC and Joe Biden spin this. You saw DNC people blame the Republicans as the bad guy standing in the way of the new deal. When it was the Union that was fighting it. The DNC needed a bad guy ""republicans"" to save face. 
Joe Biden was not going to listen to the Union and was going to do what he wants. 

That is the thing about democracy. The party leaders tell us what we want and what we need. And us like good sheeple mostly listen. We should demand they be straight with us but we don't. This allows corruption to grow and resets to happen.

If you note he admits powers are going to push their interest. He doesn't directly tell you why these interest will try to find there own way. You just can't fully trust far away powers.

He bypasses BRICS when he mentioned the economic part of the issue.
BRICS is a grain of sand in the US shoes 
More and more powerful countries who the US has very important businesses like buying oil are joining the US.
Its economic ruling if succeed, is going to bring down any super power no matter how powerful militarily it is.
And that's where I see the US maybe in ruins.
While the US it keeps playing to rule with weapons and beatings, others are playing with diplomacy, intelligence and economically. BRICS practically is going to make disappear the US beating policies and at the same time is going to impose an economic order in which the US could not be strong, with a $ without backing.
This is where a US leader has to focus in and take actions because otherwise is going to ruin its economy.
The US can't go to China with its weapons and beat it, can't go to Brasil and beat it, can't go to India and beat it, can't go to Africa or Arabia and beat them just because they are joining BRICS and not following its policies.
The us needs a leader with intelligence at this point.

People should work from home or in shopfronts on Main Street, not in corporate towers doing jobs that anybody in the world on a laptop with a Zoom account can do.

This ideology requires a complete tearing down of western society as well as others who disagree with them, in order to somehow ""create"" a utopic society. (Which has already been tried several times (Mao, Marx, Stalin, for example) and resulted in millions murdered by those monsters.)  

For decades, they've scared people with the Climate Crisis story, and have indicated that they are willing for many to die in order to ""save the planet.""  They already censor people on social media who won't call people by their gender-of-the-day pronoun!  They censored/cancelled President Donald Trump. They shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story, just before the 2020 election, which most likely changed the election results of the U.S. Presidential election! The heads of most of the legacy TV media are all doing this, as can be seen with the lying they do against anyone who is conservative. They have used technology to engulf us and even brainwash people, dividing families with scare politics. They can stop money transfers from individuals to other individuals without any way to stop them. (Go Fund Me did this during the Canadian Truckers protest (NOT a riot, as this man claims).) There is so much more to what they're up to, there isn't enough time or space to list it all, here. 

Unfortunately, they have the money and the technology to bring the world to it's knees in worship to their abomination. Who can, and is willing to stop them (Elon Musk has stood up to them, but who else can and will?)?  These world elites are NOT our friends.

Anyone greedy enough to make money is a lord with free reign to impose their value system. We never suspected greed (capitalism) and democracy could be at odds with one another. People just believe what their parents teach them even as adults. And it’s too late for useless TED talks like this. We should have asked these questions 15 years ago.,0.4526,Positive

@RichardKCollins,2023-07-02T06:24:22Z,"To hold the pieces in mind for what he described takes billions of gigabytes, and enough processing to sort through the ramifications, scenarios and implications. Not impossible, just tedious.  He forgot there are 5 billion humans now with some access to the Internet, and many of them are actually well educated and most of them thoughtful. When I review large corporations, the people are nice and thoughtful and caring, even if their business systems are archaic and unresponsive And most are trying. The nonprofits are growing but even those depend on old business models and organizational technologies.  Those digital technologies he mentioned are a tiny bump on a much larger global growth in use of computers and algorithms for everyday practical things, many experiments reaching toward the future.  TED itself is making big mistakes.  It does not gather, index and curate its comments and discussions.  It never actually builds models of futures and works to see what happens - in detail.  I and many others were doing that sort of thing 40 years ago, and small groups now can do what supercomputers could not. So I am not particularly in agreement with Ian Bremmer.  His visualizations are not animations, I think not real visualizations of real data.  He could model global trade in all the technologies. That is not that difficult.  He can model billions of humans working together. He can model the impact of 2 billion new ""first time learners"" going through global and online educations systems.  Nothing today is particularly hard, it is just tedious.  Does he want global war? Then keep talking about it and stir up resentments.  Or work for peace, rights of all humans, verification of what gets posted on the Internet and where it comes from. Seriously work at things, not just talk about them.

What is more troubling for them is their savings in RE represents multi-generational savings, i.e. mom/dad plus kids sunk their savings into the Shanghai apartment that is falling in price now. Factory lease space vacancy is becoming troublingly high, many western multinationals have left big centers. When Chinese feel wealthy, they buy gold and also travel. Gold imports into China via HK are drastically down= less wealth being spent. Travel, my contacts in Seoul tell me the Chinese are not nearly present and shopping at the big duty free shops at Lotte, Shinsagae, ect
The Chinese powerhouse is bleeding a lot of power. Also, the USA is distancing itself from China economically. It takes time and suggesting it is impossible is nonsense.
 Q... if the USA went to war with China, do you think they would find a way to de-couple from the Chinese economy? Duh? China is replaceable if there is the will.

If one reads some ancient Greek philosophers, one can see that the system named ""democracy"" always ends up in caos; why?
Because those who govern are always the persons interest in increasing their power to rule and impose their point of view; their objective is  ALWAYS to increase the size and power of the government to subject its ""citizens"".  The only proposal following a different path was established by the founding fathers of the USA, but even this great ideal was perverted and turned into shreds by the same people swearing to protect such proposal.
Globalization brought together the enemies of the idea of limited government and technology is allowing this group to take control to do as it pleases.
This is so clear to me, that even the ""leaders"" of many western ""democracies"" look like puppets acting against their own people.

@odinthoth5498,2023-06-29T07:55:57Z,"Democracy is not perfect, but it is the better of the two Evils between Democracy Vs Autocratic (Dictatorship, Communist) countries. 

Now, take these wise words, history repeats itself and Never underestimate your enemies because it will come back to bite you, history has shown us e.g. WW2  Germany against Russia, UK against America Patriots 1776, America/France Vs Vietnam, Russia Vs Afghan/Ukraine, the list goes on.

All, I will say is be ready for the unexpected and keep every option on the table, whatever it is, crazy or not.

I'm sorry to say this, now take this very seriously, history repeats itself; not exactly the same but in a different form with similar patterns and in different names in people or countries.

I can see history repeating itself with WW2, and there being a WW3; I'm really sorry to say/write this, but it has to be said/written to warn Western Democracies to get ready.

Let me explain this, WW3 war will be a war with Democracy against Autocratic countries, Russia is the Germany of the 30s and China is the Japan of the 30s, both of these countries were allowed to get rich and powerful with the help of Democracy countries allowing these Communist countries to trade, make goods, and copy our products/technology from the late 70s, early 80s and now Russia/China in the 21st century are rich, powerful, arrogant, biting the hands that fed them, Mad, out of control, out to conquer, and take back former/new land. Democracy should had not invested in a Autocratic communist Dictatorship countries in the late 70s,80s our blueprint is N.Korea is how you treat Autocratic countries then,now and in the future.

With any Communist/Dictatorship/Autocratic countries as history taught us, too much/long in power, it makes their leadership turn Mad, arrogant, Liars, change laws to stay in power, cancel treaties (e.g. Hong Kong), threatened, bully, invade weak countries and be warmongering, it have already started with Russia invasion of Ukraine and next it will be China with Taiwan next, history repeating have never failed.

What the Western Democracies should do is slowly remove chip making from Taiwan to Democracy countries, slowly remove goods making in China to poor Democracy countries in South America and Africa, which will stop or slow down illegal immigration to America and Europe and give Democracy countries like Taiwan, S. Korea and Japan the N bomb also make NATO larger (the truth is Japan, S.korea, Taiwan and Ukraine should had been members over 20 years ago) which would had tame Russia and China Madness and give them something to think about. As I said before history will repeats itself with WW3. You have been Warned!

P.S. In the future, Great Democracy countries should not trade, make goods in their countries or deal with Autocratic, communist,or any form of Dictatorship until they change to a Democracy system, it's a shame that wasn't implemented years ago in the 70s, 80s(J Edgar H, tried to warn Nixon about Commies but he wouldn't listen) China was super poor/uneducated in the 60s/70s backwards but devious, or now with any of the other Auto crazies leadership. 

Autocratic, communist, or any form of Dictatorship, can never EVER be trusted as history/future have taught us; Never Forget it, because it will come to BITE Democracy again and AGAIN!🇬🇧",-0.9668,Negative

Plus China’s GDP is artificially inflated by their real estate market, which arguably is artificially inflated and even the valuation and demand are both in decline/correction. So China is still economically significant, but a China that is gutting their own middle class that drove their prosperity will be a smaller global market for corporations to focus their efforts over.

A lot of anti-China sentiment in the West, especially as China made huge strides because of the West, while making little progress in embracing Western values. I think if Bud Light can get wrecked by cancel culture, China can too. Their projected position as number 1 or 2 is not going to be as high probability as it used to be pre-pandemic.

@enlightenedanalysis,2023-06-28T11:06:28Z,"The speaker's argument at the end is dangerous. Bremmer is essentially calling for further LIMITATION of free speech (by censorship) and INTOLERANCE to other views we may not agree with.  He asks whether we are going to allow social media companies to spread ""misinformation"" and ""hate"". Firstly, who is going to police the ""information"" and decide its ""truth""? Us or them? Philosopher kings? Who is going to watch the ""watchdogs""? For example, in 2003, if you had questioned the reasons for going to war against Iraq and said it was a bunch of lies (which it was), you would probably have been accused by media companies of spreading ""misinformation"" about the war - because the media believed the lies like everyone else.  I agree that there is a lot of stuff on social media that may be dangerous to a democracy.  But is banning or censorship of that information the correct response? It sounds authoritarian to me.

Second, we keep being told that ""hate"" is a negative and dangerous emotion. On the contrary, ""hatred"", ""anger"" and ""disgust"" are the emotions that have HELPED the human race in its evolution and survival.  For example, hatred towards things which may be harmful to us: disease, smoking and drinking.  We may hate things that go against our values: injustice, ignorance, religious fundamentalism, bigotry, nationalism, stupidity and naivety.  Any person that has given up something that they used to be addicted to (e.g. addiction to smoking, drinking, meat, over-eating) will know that the emotion of hate towards those things can be extremely helpful in overcoming temptations.

Honestly the US is using all the tricks in their sleeves to make us believe the pile of horseshit they're trying to sell us about Russia and China and other huge economical powers in Eurasia and Asia.

The techno-global order is a Web2.0 one, but Web3.0 is already here and will be the answer to a truly global world order that is more free, democratic, diverse, equitable, inclusive, and fair.

I agree with MOST of what this guy has said, the only major thing I disagree with is how he seems to still be in support of the American-led unipolar world order. He sounds somewhat nostalgic for the ""good ol' days"" when America used to be the sole ""exporter of democracy""... despite acknowledging that some of it was ""hypocritical"", he fails to understand that this ""exporting of democracy"" was done so via subterfuge, CIA interventionism, supporting of far-right extremist groups within various countries within the Global South, exploiting of the Global South's natural resources, and building of their military bases in those countries forcibly most of the time. He also fails to acknowledge the simple fact that America is NOT even a democracy anyway, it's actually a plutocracy and America exported that plutocracy ever since those so-called ""good ol' days"".

This man seems to be anti-Trump when he used that Trump example, but I'll bet he's also a ""Make America Great Again"" kinda guy, just less explicit. He's not as bold as Trump to at least say the quiet part out loud. Though if anything I think this guy would rather the slogan be ""Make the World America(n) Again""",0.9736,Positive

This agreement also gives China access to countless natural resources across continents, uses Chinese labor to construct infrastructure projects, and ensures numerous nations are in debt to them (often beyond their means of repaying). There are rumors that China has created (or will create) surveillance posts in Cuba, never mind the surveillance balloon recently shot down over the US, and the fact that the CCP has a direct method of influence over America’s youth via TikTok. China now has the largest navy in the world and has surpassed the US in the number of ballistic missile launchers it holds as well. They are effectively aligned with Russia in all matters against us and have even gotten Saudi Arabia and Iran, previously two mortal enemies, to restore diplomatic relations. They have no doubt that they will take over Taiwan, and soon, by any means necessary - as stated in their legislature. This very well may not need to be a military intervention, as they already have momentum with a popular political candidate within Taiwan who will encourage a return to China. Might I remind you that this is where the most advanced chips in the world are produced, chips which China currently does not have access to. They are working with their BRICS alliance towards removing dollar dominance by working to create a new shared currency, encouraging transactions in their own currency, and reducing reserves of USD, making our currency worth less.

Capitalism does not need democracy, China has proven this. So many companies directly controlled, and most others given a semblance of autonomy which at any moment could be ended. At some point in the near future, due to simple economics and circumstance, large scale nationalization of key military, tech, and money sectors will happen in the West.

@markstewart563,2023-06-23T17:47:00Z,"I would argue that social media has actually made the idea of rioting much, much harder than it used to be. Before social media, you could go out and join a riot and not be video recorded from dozens of different angles. A part of the effectiveness of rioting is that the rioters aren't all hauled off to prison afterwards. A huge part of our power to fight back against things that are awful was our anonymity. And that's gone now. Social media might be able to stoke collective outrage, but the general public is figuring out pretty quickly that you can't use social media to organize if you don't want to be hauled off, shot, or doxxed. The most talked about group are the Jan 6-ers. But there were dozens of people who either participated in or made the mistake of being  within like the same city block of (and had nothing to do with even) some of the George Floyd riots who had their doors kicked in while they were at home. There were a number of George Floyd organizers who were essentially SWATTED and killed outright. They never even got to the justice system to face any alleged crimes. They were simply snuffed out by the same police they were protesting/rioting against. You don't hear as much about those folks though. For all the conservative outrage about the treatment of the J6'ers, none of them were executed in their own homes. But that is pretty scary for anyone trying to organize for social justice, no? And worst of all, I did see a couple names back in 2020, but now I can't find a single reference to any of the George Floyd organizers who were killed. There have been other protests regarding police killings that made zero headlines and you can find articles about the protests, but not the victims. No, social media is what is going to weed out anyone willing to dissent (be it against against police corruption and brutality or... being actually for fascism oye) and any movement that pops up is going to be moved completely into cyberspace where it will become completely useless/harmless. I don't think we're there yet, but if political revolution ever became necessary in this country, it will be impossible to organize because of the ease and speed of information. And as social media seeps further and further into our sphere of existence, that impossibility will become pretty terrifyingly absolute.",-0.9881,Negative

@sassan428,2023-06-23T14:50:43Z,"Summary for anyone else that might be interested. 

Here are the key points:

    The speaker begins by discussing the shift from a bipolar world (dominated by the US and the Soviet Union) to a unipolar world (dominated by the US alone) to the current state, which he describes as a ""leaderless world.""

    He identifies three main reasons for this shift: Russia's exclusion from Western institutions, China's integration into US-led institutions without becoming ""American,"" and the alienation of citizens in wealthy democracies who feel left behind by globalization.

    The speaker predicts that the future will not be bipolar, unipolar, or multipolar, but will instead consist of three overlapping ""orders"": a global security order dominated by the US, a global economic order where power is shared, and a digital order run by technology companies.

    In the global security order, the US remains the only country capable of projecting military power globally. Despite Russia's and China's nuclear capabilities, the use of such weapons is still considered suicidal, making this order unipolar.

    The global economic order is multipolar, with the US and China being economically interdependent, and other countries like the EU, India, and Japan playing significant roles.

    The emerging digital order is controlled by technology companies, which have immense influence over our identities, information, and even national security. The speaker emphasizes the role of tech companies in Ukraine's defense against Russian cyber attacks, and in global events like the Capitol riots in the US, trucker riots in Ottawa, and the January 8 insurrection in Brazil.

    The speaker concludes by posing questions about the accountability of technology companies as they release powerful AI, collect unprecedented amounts of data, and persist with advertising models that turn citizens into products and promote hate and misinformation. He challenges these companies to consider their role in the erosion of democracy and to take action to address these issues.",0.1531,Positive

“Anti-Communism is anti-Semitism.”
~ Jewish Voice, July ~ August 1941.
COMMUNISM AND CENTRAL BANKING
This may seem strange. What can there be in common between Communism and the largest banks? Ho-ho! The Communism of Marx seeks an enormous centralization of the state, and where such exists, there must inevitably be a central state bank, and where such a bank exists, the parasitic Jewish nation, which profiteers from the labour of others, will always find a way to prevail. In reality, for the proletariat, this would be a barrack regime, under which the working men and the working women, converted into a uniform mass, would rise, fall asleep, work, and live at the beat of the drum."" ~ Bakunin (1814-1876)

Marxism, to which all branches of Socialism necessarily adhere, was originated by Jew Karl Marx, himself of rabbinical descent and has been dominated by them from the beginning. Marx did not actually originate anything; he merely “streamlined” Talmudism for Gentile consumption.

This list suggests there was nothing 'Russian' about the 'Russian Revolution', yet this fact is mostly obscured by contemporary historians.

    “Some call it Marxism, I call it Judaism.” – Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, in the American Bulletin of May 15, 1935.
    “The revolution in Russia is a Jewish revolution” – The Maccabean (New York), Nov. 1905, p, 250.
    “Jewry is the mother of Marxism.” – Le Droit de Vivre, May 12, 1936.“Judaism is Marxism, communism” – Harry Waton, A Program for the Jews and an Answer to All Anti-Semites (New York: Committee for the Preservation of the Jews, 1939), p. 64.

Example: Acting is not real. But the actor plays a part that imitates what is imagined to be real. 
History books tell us that Julius Caesar was assassinated and the actor plays the part as convincingly as possible. 
No matter how realistic the actor may play the part, the actor is NOT Julius Caesar.
""Realistic"" does not mean real. It's another word, having similar meaning as imitation, fake, plastic, synthetic, life-like, psuedo-.... ahem.. cough... artificial.

So when we say ""artificial intelligence"", we are admitting that the intelligence, itself, is not real but artificial and fake.

At least, the intelligence of completely natural moronic fool having the distinction of being the greatest village idiot that has ever lived, will be greater than AI no matter how advanced AI becomes.
Why is that? Because artificial is fake.

On the pessimistic side, you have series like _Blade Runner_ and _Cyberpunk 2077_ where corporations and the economies they create are the government in all but name. Ethics and basic means for survival become malleable, controlled commodities to sell to increasingly impoverished masses desperate for any escape from the dystopia they cannot escape. And they will insulate themselves with seemingly endless layers of physical, legal, and digital defenses to ensure nobody but them gains access to their kingdoms.

There's also other variations on this scale, like _Metal Gear Solid_ and _Metal Gear Rising_ with mankind's own nature and desire for control literally becoming digital overlords that try controlling the very chaos of their existence. It doesn't last forever, obviously, but the impact it leave on the world creates opportunities both good and ill (depending on how those wielding such power).

The thing is, the crux of the problem is not that tech companies are inherently evil and out to destroy democracy. The tech companies are themselves the simple logical outworking of an algorithm we devised in our economic and legal structure: American capitalism. They have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits for their shareholders. And that's what they do. If they are to do otherwise (and thus, be better actors and less of a threat to democracy) it's incumbent on our lawmakers to shape the way they need to behave through legislation.",-0.7447,Negative

2) the US domination of world trade is still enormous (almost 100% of world trade outside the EU is done in US dollars and the world's international banking system is under the control of the US).  Other economies are growing and there are attempts to bypass the US dollar and the US-dominated international banking system but most of these efforts are still in the baby steps stage.
3) the idea that the US was the principle exporter of democracy in 1989 or at any time after about 1948 is a myth.  A fondly held myth.  But a myth nonetheless.

Unless powerful tech can brute force environmental minimums and radical, long-term protection of these minimums, then we’re all pretty screwed. My concern is that people like Peter Thiel who influence much of the tech industry are climate denialists, and have never studied science in any capacity. I believe that they (tech “gurus”) are so detached from reality that their attempts at any form of universal autocratic dystopia will fail because there are insufficient resources and environmental sinks left to facilitate any more than the current rate of consumption. The tragedy is that these huge powers are built by sycophants that generally lack internalised morals, and believe they know everything because they can outsmart most other humans. Unfortunately for them, they will likely to run the human race into the ground for their insatiable and unhinged desire for total authority over our collective reality.

I guess if he was alive in 1776 he would say the british crown was the victim of colonial newspapers or something like that. As if actions don't have consequences and the people should just obey any Government without questioning or revolt in case they see no alternative.
The Capitol incident has already shown some issues in regards the narrative pushed by Big Gov and Big Media. Including federal agents letting people in, not to mention other more insidious stuff under investigation.
Also, there wasn't a ""insurrection"" in Brazil, there were pacific protests all around for months, then in January 8 a sequence of very strange things happened at the federal capital there. The ""new goverment"" allowed for protesters to get into the main area with federal government buildings, which was blocked for a long time. One would say they were even encouraged. At the same time the Government ignored their intelligence agency warnings about risks of attacks and didn't deploy any troops as usual for security duty. Also, the military head of security omitted the threat reports from the report afterwards. The same head of security was recorded by security cameras actually allowing for people to get into the building secure areas, said recordings were illegally made a state secret by their Supreme Court but someone sold/allowed it to get into the media. The Government there keep trying to avoid any actual parliamentary investigation, blocking the opposition from putting people like the former head of security (sacked from that duty a little while after the incident) into a stand at their Congress. Also, some of the ""insurgents"" (?) arrested and identified as the few that actually got into the buildings and actually destroyed things weren't in opposition  of the current government but longtime supporters that were ""dressed"" like the opposition. That and much more. Sounds more like a conspiracy with Government help to discredit the opposition then insurgency, specially considering the small amount of people being violent, the fact that it was a sunday (no one from the Government was even there, even the Supreme Court, they barely show up on mondays or fridays, many traveling to their home towns), so it can't be anything like a coup d'etat and more like a small group of dumb people doing dumb stuff with no proper objective.
So this guy is talking about things he doesn't understand and blame the middle agents for consequences of mob behaviour that happens even before we had books, it's just human nature!
Governments ignoring and running over people, even if they're wrong to any extent, instead of trying to include them in the alleged democratic process, is the main issue here. The same happened during the pandemic in many countries.",-0.8556,Negative

We let politics become a binary two party system without nuance.  And we let religion back in the side door too.  As in, our country no longer separates ""church from state"".  

The biggest issue with our system is ""first past the post"" voting.  We need ""ranked choice voting"" or better at every level of the system.  From local elections to national.  What this will do is enable more nuanced voting.  Once you have that, then multiple political parties can actually thrive again.  Only then will democracy heal and truly matter again.  We are a bipolar country without it.  We're on a skinny road with disasters on  both sides of the road and when we vote someone in, our result is overcorrection one way or the other. 

 I picture 5 political parties naturally forming out the change.  MAGA folks on the far right party.  Some super extreme lefties on the far left party.  A every man Democrat party on the left.  A middle of the road neutrality party.  And a common sense republican party on the right.  Perhaps even more in the mix.  It's a bell curve waveform.  A natural way.

@jrpark05,2023-06-20T14:12:53Z,"Very compelling, of course in reference to the digital order.  However, Mr. Bremmer in one breath calls digital postings as misinformation, conspiracy theories, and hate, and then on the other hand asks whether the digital order will open for humanity limitless opportunity or restrain freedom.

You cannot have it both ways Mr. Bremmer, and your and many others' opinions on what constitutes misinformation, conspiracy theory, and hate is just that....an opinion.  It is not objective, and is nothing close to the uncovered speech exceptions outlined in Supreme Court precedent. 

What is deeply troubling is that the vast majority of those in control of this emerging digital order have the audacity, arrogance and ego....really the god complex....to believe that their opinions are objective and completely factual, based on flawless assumptions, and therefore have assumed the power of deciding what speech is acceptable or not. 

The left-leaning person's bias has not changed in the last few decades, because these are the same people which decried George W Bush's invasion of Iraq, criticized him and tore him apart in the press, while saying NOTHING about the Democrats who voted for the war resolution, and later once again said NOTHING about the wars Obama started and continued.  

This is pure arrogance, ignorance, and massively-inflated ego at play, and if historical precedent expresses anything it is that the upcoming digital order will go in the direction of restricting freedom.  To put it another way, free speech involves the display of information you disagree with and that hurts your feefees, and if these contradictions and hypocracy continues you will see the further fragmentation and disenchantment of large swaths of the population away from participation in society.

In short, not everyone thinks the way you and other left-leaning people do Mr. Bremmer, and their thoughts and ideas have just as much right to be aired, whether you agree with it or not.",-0.8827,Negative

We move on to better things. 
The process starts in 2023.  
Daniel 12 - after 1290 years you will see an abomination... at that point wait a further 1335 years for a blessing. That blessing is immortality for humanity. No condemnation. 
that takes you to 2023. 
how do we count it?  
we have a first temple.  Solomon's temple, and an event called the abomination?  it is separated by 1290 years?  so what looks like an abomination that was Solomon's temple?  The dome of the Rock, Built between 685-691AD.  The Arabs invaded, after Muhammad was dead. waited fifty years to build it?  were they waiting until the 1290th year from Daniel's instructions?  Can you engineer it?  They commission the dome in 685, the start building in 688AD. 
Daniel says they occupy for 1260 years the outer courtyard. - so we skip 1260 and Israel is reborn. in 1948. 
that is two unlikely events on time. 
that leaves 75 years. 
Abraham is born on the 1948th year from Eden,  and enters Canaan after 75 yrs. this mirrors exactly what happened with Israel. 
after 75 yrs, on the 1335th year. God will remove his Church, the faithful bride, this is not about religion. 
All religion, all traditions, all false priesthoods, and Nicolaides - are hated by God. 
We are not religious. We love the Father and Christ, God.  We do not need Sunday services, or false good deeds. We are chosen by God to be kings and priests in heaven. We are God's children. Not followers. We are God's friends. and family. and all religion is a system of men.  what you worship is your God. If you play Golf all day, your God is Golf. 
We love God, Christ. and are leaving. 
the rest of humanity get a second chance. You missed the first cut. 
you get years to redress your priorities in life. You get years to choose. God will REVEAL everything to everyone. you are not saved by FAITH-GRACE. that age is over.
the dispensation returns to DEEDS. The Old Testament returns. and you prove yourself by your actions in these last years. 
God has wiped away your criminal records. what you do in this time is a new thing. You have the full facts and how you behave is on you entirely.  
you have no excuses. 
you have zero excuse. even saying.. i did not ask to be created.. is voided. you have a clean slate. and if you muck it up - its on YOU. 
God is there. YOU KNOW IT. and so you have no more excuses. you saw millions rise from death, saw a rapture. you have no excuses. 
If you side with Satan. Its because you are inherently evil. and want what he is offering.  If you deny Satan, Trust God and die, your soul will reach heaven. 
you showed some trust. You chose God-Christ. 
the rapture is the next event in God's calendar. it is slated for 2023.  You all see massive miracles.  no excuses. you get full knowledge, something we Christians did not get.

The initial premise of this entire discussions seems odd and places a viewer in a mindset filled with literally out of context basis. Foreign countries are without any proof and data being presented as WANTING to be under the US security order. To then pivot to how technology companies and AI are ripping countries apart? This talk is a dogs breakfast of word salad ideas. If he had balls, he'd suggest that energy independence was the super power. That local manufacturing via smart machines was the super power. He brought AI into the discussion and absolutely its true, but likely not in what people expect. AI is just a personal assistant, makes us all smarter. The next super power is TRUTH in ACTION. The societies that push truth to the forefront will gain the cultural edge that everyone else will want to emulate. He's spot on, we get a mesh global strength map for the next few years but he didn't follow the course to really drive the answer. The US ""won"" because russians and chinese wanted to be americans. Now - NOBODY wants to be american. There is a cultural void that won't be hard for a society to pivot too. Your greatest export will be your culture moving forward and the struggle and governments resist the TRUTH in ACTION movements will not survive.

@NorseGraphic,2023-06-19T20:00:03Z,"The presenter seems oblivious to the fact that technology power and economic power are two sides of the same coin. These multi-national corporations are gaining more and more influence in political policies usually reserved for the citizens. They’ll start to make the rules and enforce those, first through the judicial system. But they’ll quickly realize it’s cumbersome to rely on public servants.
 
Thus the rise of corporate enforcement of the new ‘terms of service’. We already have private security-corporations, though they don’t have the ‘rights’ to enforce the law like the police. Currently they’re forced to relay information to the police, who then act on enforcing the law. This is time-consuming and cumbersome.
 
So they’ll want first smaller pieces of legislation for themselves to enforce the T.O.S for themselves and their clients. This will then grow in scope until the public law enforcement has either been privatized or shut down. 
 
The national governments legitimacy and influence will shrink, while corporate power will subsume as much as they can in the process. Elections, already controversial, will only be theatricals for the poor unwashed masses. While real power is kept in the board rooms.",-0.6522,Negative

3. China, and to a lesser extent, the EU, are leading on regulating technology companies. The US reaction to this is ""authoritarianism"" even as American legislators debate some of the same constraints. Clearly the world needs such regulation & USA will not dictate the terms as thus ultimately is national law.

They function as independent corporations but they cannot raise rates or even profit levels  without permission from the state  and local power regulatory commissions.

@nancyboyette3748,2023-06-19T15:01:26Z,"I don’t know the date this speech was given but for sure much has changed. 

Greed, a lack of accountability, AI, fake news, NATO/Globalist elites under the deception of global warming, America’s arrogant and entitled belief that it should rule and police the earth, Pharma and illicit biolab research and the money they use to persuade countries to house them are the crippling issues that threaten the world today.

Fortunately people are waking up world wide, verifying facts, exposing lies and pushing back on its leaders. In this regard, I think Americans have an advantage and opportunity to lead the way out of this tyranny because of our constitution and bill of rights. The three main ones are freedom of speech, the right to bear arms and the separation between church and state. All three are being attacked. 

Russia weathered the storm of sanctions and is very strong and strategic. They have oil, gold, support of it’s citizens, strong borders, military might and much more. Russia still exerts power over its people and enemies in unethical and unfair ways. They could use some training in diplomacy and restraining force.

Europe/NATO is weak due to US influence and climate change nonsense and is dependent on other countries for energy (Namely Russia and Saudis). 

China is a house of cards beginning to fall. On the surface, they look like a superpower but they’re not. They recently tried out some of their missies but had problems because of faulty electronics and bomb duds. Their unemployment rate is  high and people over 35 are not allowed to apply for the good jobs. Major manufacturers by the masses are closing and moving to Vietnam and India. China’s real estate is tanking. Their infrastructure and buildings are shoddy and crumbling (Tofu structures). Birth rate is low and masses of Chinese are trying to leave by any means possible. Once again, Communism and totalitarianism fail again and destroy its people. 

AI and technology is our future and is frightening in the hands of our current world wide leadership.

@OblivionOdditiesProjectStudios,2023-06-19T13:32:11Z,"I have a legitimate plan that would work but we all would need to be able to come together & unite as one force! If we can save GAMESTOP, a company known for ripping us off, we should be able to do this! We won when we did that too so we already know it's possible!

If we had a entertainment corporation that's designed like a union that'll use the money we give them to protect our rights & bend the laws back into our favour as individuals that'll help build a new entertainment industry separate from the horrible history that today's Hollywood has, we would start a modern day revolution! Let me explain.

So, we all know that corporations use the money WE give them to bend the laws into their favour. When we protest these things they normally don't last long & are done in short burst. They know that they'll win no matter what cause at the end of the day, your only options is to give the lesser of evils your money. There isn't a ""Good Corporation"" to be an option. 

They know this is a negative feedback loop. We give them our money cause we don't have a choice. They use that money to abuse power & bend the laws into their favour to oppress use. When we protest they use their money to control the cops. Cops have to listen to the corporations & their rules. The ones that makes those rules are the creators of the corporations. If we create the corporations, we make the rules & get the same protection as them. We would be able to throw our money around like they do.

Do you think that they're going to start a unpeaceful protest if there's a CEO in front of the protesters willing to sue them into the ground for each person they touched? We could sponsor protest & give money to local shops & farmers to host extremely long protests!

We could win if everyone came together to create & support a brand new entertainment corporation willing to go out of their way to protect our rights. Even if they don't have content to give us immediately, wouldn't donating $1 a month be worth it to invest in our future & create the future that WE want! 

We can't do a bloody revolution in today's era of information & technology! That's unrealistic & we would lose too many lives. But staying connected to each other has never been easier! Everyone keeps calling Capitalism a game. Well they're right! But what they don't understand is that we're a generation of GAMERS! 

We came together to save gamestop. We can come together to do this. 

I know it sounds like a LOT of work. But I have already been putting in that work! I have been collecting information & solutions to build a new foundation & framework based on modern mathematically proven to work plans & methods for 20 years! 

I have been building a company that'll produce content & help others produce & protect their content for 10 years! 

I have been going at it alone for too long! I need help! I NEED SUPPORT! The revolution might not look how you expected it but its here! This is your call to action! It's our money & we decide our future with it! 

People like Dwayne McDuffie walked so we could run. All you got to do is to, believe me, read the ""about me"" in the Oblivion Oddities Project Studios Patreon all the way through to the end. Then decide for yourself if your future is worth it.

His failure to mention the hundreds of riots, property destruction and death's caused by the fascist organizations of Black Lives Matter and Antifa which were made possible, encouraged, condoned and justified by those same organizations of big government, giant multinational corporations, big tech and mainstream news mediums seems to show his political position.

I also see too much power being concentrated into the hands of a few big tech giants who, as we now know, collude with our government to censor us. I don't, however, take the defeatist attitude that Democracy is destined for destruction. I would point out that prior to the internet, mainstream corporate media had a much greater monopoly on the news. At present, we have countless independent journalists who are not controlled by the financial and political elites. Of course, those corrupt entities that are used to having a monopoly on the news are outraged by this loss of power and are demanding more censorship (as if allowing the people to do their own thinking were the end of Democracy rather than the beginning of it). But the big tech companies are in a quandary because too much censorship creates a market opportunity for an alternative free-speech platform to take away market share. My assessment is that in order to preserve Democracy, we the people must continually fight against those who seek to take it away. We need to see to it that to the greatest extent possible power and wealth are decentralized so that the next world superpower will not be a government but rather the people.",0.8526,Positive

Now tech companies have an ""invisible"" power but at some level they still represent the interest of the power that they share with the State, which is the US government. Liberal democracy is a lie! For sure it can get even worse if people cannot control tech companies and their policies, domestically and internationaly. Besides of that he has good points I see a very possible. First a 2.0 Cold War, limited to the technological and ""cyber world"", very likely. US will still be a super military power, I agree. But it will lose control of their World Economy policies they can apply, including the sanctions... Russia is not losing like he said. If US loses it's economic power it will eventually lose the ability so suppport such an imense military power while people living in the country will start to delcine living standards. This is already happening btw, not different from what happen to the real Cold War where URSS had to direct most of it's economy to military. The emerge of the BRICS leaded by China is the true antagonist to the saction war that US and the West Countries can apply, in that world, countries cannot be isolated anymore (unless militarily). In that scenario IMF and World Bank will lose most of their power. I still think US has a significant head start: They control the Tech Companies and still have the biggest military power by far, but that is pretty much all. Other powers that may benefit from working with China will emerge and the tech companies could and are already being used to destroy those countries democracies, look at Brexit and other things that happen in the past like the Arab Spring that destroyed the sovereign of some countries like Lybia and Syria... UK is not doing that well and now with the Ukrayne War EU is also not that good... It will be a world of a economic emerging power vs Hibryd Warfare.",-0.9759,Negative

However, I do not agree with his assessment of the Current World Order. Specifically, his  opinion that the USA is the dominant millitary power and will remain so till the next decade. It seems Mr Bremmer is ill informed about the millitary debacles of the USA and its allies in Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine in the last decade. He also does not speak about the rise of BRICS, De Dollarization, US debt crisis, and decrease of Western influence in the Global South. Contrary to his assumptions, Russian economy is actually growing, while Europe and USA are gradually sliding into recession.

@alexhormann6189,2023-06-19T02:02:10Z,"Governments are so powerful because it integrates these orders into their wider portfolio. Integrating these orders took a compromise. The security and economic orders gave access to governments to exert limited control over their function through legislation and in return they too did get a say in other orders. The same goes for health, research, intelligence, education... the list goes on. Each order gave up a chunk of its autonomy for 1) the trust of the people (by far the one greatest asset any government can offer), 2) some taxpayer money backup in times of need, and 3) limited ability to also control the fates of other orders. If we as the people want a greater say over these increasingly powerful independent digital and intelligence companies then perhaps it's time we integrate them into government and allow them a say over other governmental affairs. And if they're as important as this TED talk suggests they are, then they need a level of authority that matches (e.g. front bench ministers of digital affairs or secretary of digital affairs as coveted portfolios with a decent amount of governmental power). In the past, we have seen the effects of governments that did not pay enough respect to their military or economy. These institutions fought back with disastrous conclusions.

@pwnedd11,2023-06-18T22:00:43Z,"This guy is a total moron. He claimed that Russia was not integrated into Western institutions. This is false. They were very much integrated in the Western economic system (though very poorly in the sense that it killed the Russian economy -- but it was integration). And if Russia had fully gotten rid of their own internal communist threat, then NATO was an option. Everybody forgets that communists weren't that far away from winning in 1996 (it took the whole media working against them along with potential minor election rigging to beat the communists). And the Yeltsin and Putin conspired to move up the election sooner in 2000 -- something they would not have done if communism was not a threat. So, to be safe, America and Europe brought in other countries into NATO on the off chance that Russia became communist again. But the moment the communist threat was over, they would have been brought in. And then, Russia went authoritarian in the other direction. But they were still integrated into Western economies. 

Then he claimed that Americans expected the Chinese to become American. And he claimed they remained Chinese. This is insulting and evil. I know Chinese people, and they are not necessarily ok with a totalitarian regime at home. So, to want a non-totalitarian regime is not to ""become American,"" nor to ""no longer be Chinese."" Rather, absurd and idiotic hope of the West was that economic liberty would lead to political liberty. That was the supid thing. But it was not a hope that Chinese would become American. Rather, it was a hope that their government would change.

Third, he mis-assesses all the factors surrounding and leading up to January 6th. He forgets that in the year 2000, 2004, 2016, and 2020, there have been suspcions regarding US presidential elections (the first three times were suspicions from Democrats and the last from Republicans). Suspicion is not conspiracy. And a demand for accountability toward ballot counters along the line of what happens in the financial world between business people and accountants -- is likewise not a conspiracy. It was only after 4 of the past 6 US presidential elections were in dispute -- with no effort from the elites toward regulation -- that people started thinking that ""somthing might be wrong, here."" And right or wrong, that is not conspiracy. That is an understandable psychological reaction.

Last but not least, to think that we would have a techno-polar world is likewise foolish, considering the extreme techno-anarchy that he himself acknowledges regarding January 6th (whether he's right or not is another matter -- it just shows how inconsistant he's being). The only way to eliminate the techno-anarchy is with governmental assistance or complacency -- assistance in the form of governmental regulation or complacency in the form of governments letting somebody else do the regulation. In either case, favors will be exchanged, and this will mean the continued back and forth between corporations and states that currently exists.

All of this and more is why political science can be a foolish subject. Ignore anybody who proclaims certainty through poor methodology.",-0.9616,Negative

Peoples of the U.S. and around the world are opposed by a monolithic covert ruthless anti-humanity world system that has conspiratorially conscripted vast human and physical resources into the building of a tightly knit highly efficient machine/system that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, technocratic, communications(media-propaganda), and political operations. The dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many decades, and centuries. It challenges the very survival of mankind; it manifests in all spheres of human activity, and affects everybody on the planet. It controls in varying degrees 95% of the worlds governments. Just one of its agendas is to de-populate the planet by over 95% of its present population. Its not possible to successfully coexist with totalitarianism on super-steroids, or any despotic regime, which will always lead to death. There is ONLY one course of action that can deal successfully with this tyranny, and that is to eradicate it, primarily by guerilla warfare beginning with the corrupted, global-cabal controlled, totalitarian government of the country you presently reside in.

Problem is that any international lefal disputes in the IP world have to be resolve in US courts. Problem is the US constitution does not have any kind of protection for non-US citizens or corporations against the actions of US government agents. And the US Government has It's own Rules Based World Order which is often not aligned with the UN international laws. The classic example is that ""terrorism"" is defined in international laws as ""the unlawful (domestic laws) use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims."" but is defined instead in the Rules Based World order as ""the unlawful (US laws) use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims, unless those aims are to bring freedom and democracy in that country"".

- profit will continue to drive all, and that same profit influences wealthy politicians, so they will not impede anything that drives profits.  (Such as AI)

- artificial intelligence, which is just a fancy buzzword way of saying ‘more powerful computing algorithms’ will be a huge driver of future profits, along with steady increase in shipping/process/manufacturing/farming/energy-delivery/services automation 

- this will eventually result in virtually EVERY single non-csuite job we know today being toast…replaced via automation.    This may take many decades.  But it will happen.

- the amount of new jobs created as a result of the 98% automated world will be a TINY fraction of the ones that go away.  

- the working population will shrink tremendously.   Society will adapt and there will be a much smaller population.

@marxxthespot,2023-06-18T18:21:24Z,"Technology companies will, of course, NOT choose democracy. Why? Because capitalism is inherently UNDEMOCRATIC!

Our workplace is entirely top down driven with the guiding principle of maximizing short-term quarterly goals, interests & profits🤮 Even non-profits have chosen this undemocratic model… because we really don’t know any other way 🤷🏻 

The ruthless pursuit of the short-term self-interests of corporations and the filthy rich under capitalism is wrecking havoc as they loot our shared wealth and institutions because it is perfectly legal (and even incentivized) to privatize economic benefits while pushing costs onto the public. This is no more apparent than the exploding labor market in United States prisons that pay prisoners $1hr while tax payers pay for their food and shelter. Similarly, most fast food workers receive food stamps because they don’t receive living wages. 

Tools aid our work and are good for workers BUT automation replaces workers. 400 years of capitalism has a near 100% track record of replacing workers with automation as opportunity arises. The existential crisis being felt by artists right now is no different than what auto workers felt when robotic arms took over the manufacturing of cars. AI is already replacing artists on a massive scale. This is playing out in the writers strike in Los Angeles. Artists work is the most nuanced and least formulaic work there is in that, at it’s best, is unique, personal and universal.

@donnydutchmen1284,2023-06-18T17:56:34Z,"Absolutely ridiculous what this guy is saying. Uprisings are of all times. Riots will happen even without social media. You can, of course, look at who is adding the fuel to the fire, but that is unimportant. You need to know why oil is being thrown on the fire. That's more important. This man's theory would have held up had the numbers been in his favor compared to the times before social media. And they don't. In fact, before social media there were much more uprisings than now. Uprisings in which entire regimes were overthrown. The reason why there are fewer revolts than before has to do with the fact that people now have the choice in their own hands about what information they consider to be truth and which side of the spectrum they are on. Opinions have become much more fragmented than before, thus making it more difficult to build consensus on a specific vision/goal. And that's where all the division comes from. The times of an Adolf Hitler who gets an entire country on his side are over. The government is now struggling with the fact that they have lost this force majeure, and can no longer compete with the way too many opinions that this causes. So the only way they can still achieve this is by fabricating a massive crisis with which they can divide people into two clear camps, so that voters can once again move to a ballot box in unison. It is precisely this effect that we see taking shape today. They can no longer get the collective on their side, with not even their greatest effort. Because there are no longer large unified groups, but instead much more fragmented groups. In the past that was not possible because you only heard 1 sound, and people lived much more in their own fixed and isolated communities with (if you were lucky) a subscription to one or two newspapers, and if you were very rich maybe the option to buy a TV. There were usually two reasons why people revolted at the time. 1 when they were directly disadvantaged or when they were too poor to afford food. Or 2 because of governments and newspapers who spread stories about one big thread/enemy in which they could recruit masses of people for an uprising. But today that has become almost impossible, because with a little searching on the internet you can easily filter exactly all the nonsense out. So now people no longer allow themselves to be pushed by their governments under false pretenses, just because they have the biggest voice. And they can no longer use the church for that either, since its influence has seriously diminished today. That is why they are now trying to brainwash and incite children/young people in schools and universities for their propaganda, activism, demonstrations and all other kinds of dirty practices. Or preferably people with an average IQ of that of Greta Thunberg. What used to be in the newspapers and said on TV was the only truth you ever got to hear, because the other side of the story was hardly ever told. Only a few people who had the money to travel to far and distant countries or even the other side of the world, were able to see what it was really like. Rebellions before the arrival of social media were therefore much easier to realize and incite, because there was only 1 big horn that was heard, and could move these people in such large numbers. This is exactly why China and North-Korea let almost nobody in or out their countries, and have a very dictatorial supervision over their news media, internet/TV connections.",-0.986,Negative

To the extent anyone or any country hurts people, in any way  (militarily, technologically, non win-win economics, creating of fear, etc), they will fail and fall, sooner or later and be replaced. As one sows, so does one reap, it all comes back, equal and opposite reactions - however you would like to put it, religiously or scientifically. c) There are important non-conventional non-mainstream info of which Ian is not aware, with enough evidence for sufficient verification, d) Ian leaves out cultural leadership, such as in arts and fashion, which are more important than he seems to realize. People get attracted to countries and cultures that make them feel happy and give them pleasure and enjoyment; e) Spirituality is left out, not only the power of morality, but of also transcendence in both experience and understanding; f) the radical acceleration of change that has been going on for millennia (Cf. de Chardin The Phenomenon of Man);  To summarize, Ian's talk is short on what could be called feminine values: the heart, love, pleasure and enjoyment, the power of 'soft,' etc. And the gigantic awareness and evidence for a resurgence of ""the Feminine,' especially in Western culture. This entire area of life keenly needs to be added to Ian's palette. Note Roy Dalio's comment that India PM Modi is the world's best leader, and Modi's telling him in their interview that he does not care about leading, he is motivated by helping people. As different cultures become dominant, a different kind of non-Western thinking and behavior also arise. And, note that their first interview topic is meditation. Dalio credits his practice of Transcendental Meditation is the main if not sole reason he has been so successful. 'Consciousness' is now the most important topic in Western academic philosophy, having replaced language philosophy decades ago. The rest of culture has tended to quietly follow philosophical trends for millennia. g) ""Do not be in awe of computers. Be in awe of the human brain."" - Maharishi - the power of consciousness can also develop vastly, with many capabilities far beyond what AI can do or ever will be able to do. As that develops, AI will remain a servant of people; h) Many spiritual visionaries are forecasting a golden age, an age without significant problems, will begin to be widely visible between 2025 and 2030, and the world will be free of significant problems c. 2050 - 2075.

A great example is his talking point about America having all these resources to put military anywhere around the globe well that's technically not the case because if we could do that we wouldn't have pulled out of Afghanistan to fight the Russian war in Ukraine.. America does not have unlimited resources and we are slowly losing more and more resources by the year. 

We also are losing confidence in our allies when it comes to the US dollar so I don't know where he gets the idea that we would continue to have an overwhelming control in the shared power across the globe countries are slowly drifting away from the US dollar which is happening currently in the year 2023.

To keep these unpopular regimes in power, extreme violence was used against their populations, with the help of the US. Once violence is unleashed, it perpetuates itself for decades. The migratory pressure under which the US is is a consequence of these policies. So no, the US only promotes democracy when it is in the interests of it's influential corporations, which is still better than Russia and Chine for whom democracy is never in the interest of it's ruling elite.

@WowLuvya,2023-06-18T06:34:21Z,"Well said and great pondering questions for humanity! All of this is predicated on the assumption we are all the same, humans. Nothing to date is comprehensible to normal thinking, caring humans. With all the information available now the possibility of alternate ENTITIES occupying Mother Earth causing havoc is distinctly probable if not TRUE. These ENTITIES may have seeded us or were usurpers of Mother Earth. That would explain all the devastation they cause on Mother Earth. They are unable to think like humans, with compassion, feel love, care about other humans, offer protection, guide with greater goodness for humanity and on. Much to our chagrin they use and abuse  humanity. Humanity corralled into being consumers for self enrichment of money, useless eaters to be consumed as food and  children used as adrenochrome blood drinks, young men endlessly war mongered to death killing civilians in never ending wars on humanity, no one can fathom. We stand under them. They have rendered good men, impotent and unable to protect us and Mother Earth.",-0.2599,Negative

That’s a very weak proposition to claim that the third world order is the digital order. It is more like a cross between economic market and tech order. Tech companies are still for profit companies and so they will try to make profits and comply to regional regulations or they risk being kicked out of the regional market. The tech companies can lobby for legislations in their favor, but ultimately, the power still goes to the countries. Just look at China’s example, the government can shutdown any tech companies if they see fit without needing to go through any due process. So China in itself is in complete control over their tech companies and their tech companies is in no position to resist the regulation. 

Even at the topic of the semiconductors and critical minerals, the point is not that the US is trying to bring the world economy towards it because every country in the world would try to have more economic power at any time, so that’s not the point; the point should pertain to what circumstances is changed and what the new goal is. The point is to reduce the reliance on China regarding supply chain because the US realizes that China will become more hostile (instead of more integration to Weatern ideals and interests) and US cannot depend on China for anything critical, especially at the risk of war when China can shutdown critical part of the supply chain. Economic power and market share is important but they are nothing in comparison to a country’s security.

Bremmer is completely full of it and there is no coherence to his logic. 

#1, The U.S. was, and still is the leader of the world. The U.S. still polices the sea to ensure safe travel and passage for global trade to happen. And the American government controlled dollar is the only credible reserve currency. If the world truly becomes leaderless, then wars resume, just like the age of empires. 

Look at the countries most interested in obtaining resources and territory: China and Russia, the authoritarian countries. They will take territory and resources to blackmail anyone who does not agree with their policy, just like how Russia did with Europe. And the vast majority of Europe does not produce much of the natural resources and needs to import them. Do you think they will stand around waiting to be blackmailed? Maybe they are looking forward to using coal-fired vehicles.

#2 Technology companies still require a physical presence, therefore are obligated to follow the laws of the government. They will never be able to control the digital space without the approval of governments. Case in point, Chinese companies must send all their data to the CCP; Chinese companies must abide by the great firewall and censor certain topics to fit the CCP’s narrative; Tiktok will have to sell its company if American lawmakers decide it must, otherwise it will cease to operate within the U.S. border and possibly its allies; google was forced by the U.S. government to cease allowing the use of Android Operating System to Chinese phone makers; Google and Amazon were never really able to operate in China due to hostile business environments created by the CCP.

Computer technology poses absolutely no threat to democracies in a leaderless, disconnected world. Computer technology is PART of the industrial revolution, not separate from it. The IT revolution is only possible by a relatively free market environment, massive investments (think American dollars) into startups and R&D, and a globalized interconnected market. Russia and China does not have the domestic market capability nor the personnel to dominate the tech field without being part of globalization.

And for those of you who might think China can absorb Taiwan and TSMC, first the U.S. will not let TSMC fall into the hands of CCP without it being absolutely obliterated. And second, if China ever attacks Taiwan, the U.S. and its allies will sanction China just like they did Russia which will result in a total collapse due to the Chinese having to import the vast majority of its food and energy. If all else fails, the U.S. will just station a Aircraft Carrier battle group in the Indian ocean and confiscate or destroy every single oil tanker that is heading to China.

First of all, the ""West"" is pushing unified and common policies of DEI and ESG like no other push it has made in the past.  These are the wants of the super wealthy backing the modern day liberals.  Many of these values and policies, conflict with free markets and past values, traditions, and norms of the West such as free markets, free speech, and a much freer society.  Tech in large part to blame for this as tech billionaires are key people behind funding these liberals.  However, the Western world is not that excited about all these forced policy and values changes being pushed onto society.  The East, is also forming an economic block as a response to weak leadership in the West and really, anti traditional Western leadership and policies.  I'll fast forward as there is so much to say.  Voters need to get true conservative thinking back into office, negotiate peace to the Ukraine-Russia, and get back towards global cooperation and values that built the world and abandon much of the current day nonsense that is unleashing instability and unrest onto the world.....",0.9242,Positive

@charlesronk2989,2023-06-18T01:54:55Z,"This is ridiculous. This comes from the fact that Capitalism can never survive without massive interference from government and extreme Social policies.

The goal of an individual corporation is to maximize profit. In doing this each company is destroying the consumer base it has to have in order to survive. This is why the push for trade deals. You can destroy your domestic consumer base while maintaining profits. Pro corporate policies assist companies in this destruction. It is why Americas middle class is collapsing and China's is on the rise. 

The media in the United States owned by these same corporations manipulates the public to gain wealth and maintain the power structure. Pushing nonsense both left and right to maintain the status quo. 

Without massive changes the United States will collapse within the next half century. 

The first fix for this is to detox the public. This would have to start by making any media source that reports news to be independent and non-profit. Also making them legally liable for misinformation. Which means massive changes to the first amendment. You would also have to replace and restructure SCOTUS. You would also have to force companies doing business in the United States to pay an adjustable rate VAT tax. Thats rate is adjusted to provide the public with a UBI with a COLA attached. Call it a National profit sharing plan. 

Do this along with enacting a wealth tax to provide college or trade school for the population.  Also enact a M4A policy. Remove the cap from Social Security and reduce the early retirement age to 58. Do this and the United States would be the dominant country for centuries. 

There is a lot of other things that would need to go along with this. Like raising intrest rates and making borrowing more difficult. Encouraging people to save money.  You would also need to ban urban sprawl. Force people to reclaim urban wastelands. This will be required to maximize food production also holding down land rental rates to keep food costs in check.

China was a low tech agricultural economy for a long time until Western big business set up shop and moved the Worlds Industrial supply chain to the far East. So, while Western media were telling us all how nasty and inhuman China was/is, our very own Western Governments and big business  were happy colluding with and exchanging tech, industrial supply chains and manufacturing with a totallitarian regime that murdered its own people. But you know, it was nothing personal, just business??!! The West has created its own internal monster through Corporate greed, and socio economic chaos back home by throwing home employees on the scrap heap with low paid service sector work as the alternative. This was never going to end well, big business has food production, medicine, private finance ownership of public and government infrastructure coupled with no real responsibility. Our governments nothing more than powerless flimsy puppets to the Western powerful business elite. They also have the power to lobby governments to make life easier for them and change laws and trade barriers to suit themselves, this explains the Wests ever declining quality of life for its citizens. Blaming China and Russia does not explain anything if you dig enough, and you do not need to dig far. Big business and greed has allowed the West to screw itself over in the end. The USA is still a great country, and we need a strong US to counterbalance China, Russia and the other emerging BRICS nations. But the US has allowed obscene wealth and greed to over rule its own people and dignity, the US needs to reign in some of these unelected super powerful elites and remodel itself internally to support its own people through mixed employment with manufacturing and industrial supply chains again. Moving everything to the Far East was an incredibly dumb thing to do, do you think the people of a culture as intelligent as the Chinese are going to continue as the Wests sweat shop forever??!!

A multipolar economic world is what we have now. This guy hasn't gotten the memo about BRICS yet, and he probably should inform himself urgently because it'll change some of his core premises. I'll also grant that his assessment of the nexus of power of multinational megacorporations, though he's incorrect to think it's only tech companies that are a threat. Pfizer proved that though I doubt this poor man has any clue about it because he's allowed himself to believe the corporate press releases instead of looking at the data that shows they lie (about literally everything). But add on the Amazon and Alibaba's of the world, Seimens and Catepillar, Blackrock and Vanguard and their control over the financial sector... Yes, Google's actively creating Orwell's Big Brother, but it's hardly the only threat to people's individual freedoms.

What he seems to have done is bought the western security state narrative without question and brought forth his really factless hypothesis as if  he's the only person in the world who thought of it.

Russia is more powerful today than before the war.
Russia has only gained allies and the United states has only lost them.
BRICS is now a larger financial block than the West and they have 31 countries applying including several allies of the US.
In bringing sanctions, the only thing the US managed to do was to bring together our two biggest rivals who were once enemies, and then lost the petro dollar which will devastate the American economy.
Russia does not need the American economy. They are very self sufficient country that, in sharp contrast to the lies the MSM, are very much behind Putin in standing up to the US corporatists.
The people in Russia who were against Putin and the Special Millitary Opperation (the War in Ukriane) have largely left Russia with the blessing of Moscow, leaving Russia a state in more harmonious state than America which seems at the brink of a neo civil war every day..

Ian Bremmer predicts a leaderless world with three different orders: global security, global economic, and digital. The US dominates the global security order while the global economic order is multipolar with power shared among the US, China, EU, India, and Japan. Technology companies hold immense power in the digital order, determining our identities and information flow.

Highlights
🌍 A leaderless world with three different orders: global security, global economic, and digital.
🇺🇸 The US dominates the global security order, but other countries are becoming more powerful.
🌎 The global economic order is multipolar with power shared among the US, China, EU, India, and Japan.

Mr Ian Bremmer sounds like an entrepreneur who conduct his business on the net, not in person.
He says U.S. has withdrawn from the world for the last 15 years! 
Doesn't he lives on this planet?
The U.S. invaded two countries, Afghanistan and Iraq, in 2001 & 2003, respectively. Had it worked, as it was intended, it would have been a potent strategic move for controlling the world.
Then, since 2010, as the Chinese economic mass and its gravitational force got an astronomical pace, the U.S. started shifting its focus to East Asia. Why?
Because, it realised that, it could not fight, even two wars and win them, let alone fighting 80 wars in different parts of the world and win them, as they believed.

If you think of what happened since the September 2001 till 2022, it seems to be the same recipe which prescribed to all superpowers which came before the U.S.

A combination of foreign events, internal discord, economic and financial desasters, rise of mighty rivals, geopolitical missjudgments, overconfidency ...

That's the way all superpowers fall:
""All that is due to their arrogance in land and evil plotting; but, these evil plotting encompass es none but the very evil plotters... Do they expect anything but the way their predecessors were dealt with?
Nay, you will not find any change in the way of Allah, dealing with the arrogant superpowers."" (Quran; 35:43)

That there are people in the World who think differently & do not scare easily. Turns out Faith old fashioned as it is has still got a role to play. I disagree with this his version of how the World will be.",0.91,Positive

2) Make no mistake, Russia is in decline right now. As well as the nonsense about the loss of 200K Russian servicemen in Ukraine and devastating sanctions.
3) China's PPP GDP overtook the US back in 2014, but no one in the US wants to admit it.
4) It is hardly correct to speak only about the technological order without mentioning the media space. And given the media space, we already live in a multipolar world. It can't just be a bipolar world.
5) Also, make no mistake - tech and media companies are dependent on the elites of the deep state. They don't act alone.
6) In terms of Internet technologies, today the largest independent centers are the USA, China, and to a lesser extent Russia. But as markets develop, you can be sure that such independent centers will develop in India, Latin America, the Middle East and possibly other regions. This is predetermined by language and civilizational barriers.
7) It is hardly worth exaggerating the role of NATO in the cyber defense of Ukraine.
8) Mr. Bremmer is right about US exporting tools that destroy democracy. But he does not say that the American elites are doing this in an attempt to cling to world hegemony. But diarrhea can hardly be held with hands

Capitalism is again transitioning. Just as it transformed after WWII from national, industrial capitalism to international, finance capitalism, it is now transitioning into what could be called ""data"" capitalism, controlled primarily by multinational corporations based for the most part in either the US or  China, but with questionable, dare I say ""fluid"", allegiances to either of these political entities. This is leading to a hyper-concentration of economic and political power in the  hands of those who own and/or manage these corporations, wherever they are geographically located. All of which raises questions that Ian hints at but doesn't fully articulate: what is the future, if any, of the nation state and its institutions upon which people in western countries have relied since WWII? and if the nation state is in fact in its terminal phase, how quick will be its demise, and what will replace it? Are the leaders of finance capitalism, the largest banks and financial insitutions, set to profit from this transition, or will they be eaten by it? Hard to imagine they'll take it lying down... And finally, will this all spell the last gasp of electoral democracy and individual rights and freedoms, ushering in a new feudalism where individual survival is highly contingent on one's unquestioning loyalty to their employer or other non-state entity, such as religion, social grouping, union, trade or professional association?

@ADobbin1,2023-06-17T13:55:32Z,"Personally I think the next global super power will be a shadow power called the World Economic Forum. It will be Corporate. Most large corporations today have budgets larger than most countries and the only reason they don't spend the excess money on military power is because so far they chose not to bother and would influence rules indirectly instead of taking on the headache of running government. Once they no longer get what they want quietly through the shadows by campaign donations and lobbying their friends in government or if normal government fails, like say the aftermath of a global conflict, I see a future where that changes and the corporations take over to ""maintain economic stability and profitability to benefit society as a whole"". Just my two cents. Either that or the AI's will run the world and we will all be slaves.",0.8532,Positive

The figure of 200,000 Russian troops 'lost', for instance, needs to be looked upon with some suspicion. Whose figures does he cite? Also, the casual reference to the effect of sanctions, which seems to take it as a given that they have crippled the Russian economy. Damaged somewhat, perhaps, but not significantly (while at the same time, the economy of Germany - and therefore of Europe - has been dealt a possibly fatal blow by the actions, principally of the US)
The references generally to the conflict, seem to come from a position firmly behind the US/NATO narrative of Russia being the totally unjustified aggressor. The speaker seems to have fallen in line with the huge simplification that abounds in the Western MSM; ignoring the events that led to the conflict.

@ywtcc,2023-06-16T18:42:55Z,"Bremmer's counterfactuals with regards to social media disinformation and civil unrest are what they are - counterfactuals.
It may be the case that without social media, there would be more civil unrest. Maybe the bigger factor is commercial, tabloid style political media. Isn't that, after all, the source of their political power?
It's hard to disentangle where fault lies in this case, it seems to be in a lot of places.
If you want to blame the internet for spreading misinformation, you also need to give the internet credit for spreading information, to be fair.
And, if you're going to blame misinformation for civil unrest, you can blame information for its part in civil unrest, also. There's an assumption Ian has that if everyone just had the right information, they'd all blindly support the government! At some points in history it's the opposite, more information about the government leads to more civil unrest.

It is a form of anarcho-capitalism that says corporate power should be the only power (and this is expressly because they are ""better"" than everyone else so deserve to rule).   Some also call it neo-feudalism.  Hanns Hermann Hoppe is a thought leader.  It is an extension of Ayn Rand's ""Greed is Good"" and the Free-Market/Privatize Everything movement.  Elon Musk, Peter Theil, and others are proponents.   

Here is one of Hoppe's most terrifying quotes:  ""...insurers would... be particularly interested in gathering information on potential... crimes and aggressors... [A]lways under competitive pressure, they would develop and continually refine an elaborate system of demographic and sociological crime indicators. That is, every neighborhood would be described, and its risk assessed, in terms of a multitude of crime indicators, such as... its inhabitants' sexes, age groups, races, nationalities, ethnicities, religions, languages, professions, and incomes."" 

And another: ""In a natural order, there is no such thing as ""freedom of migration."" People cannot move about as they please. Wherever a person moves, he moves on private property; and private ownership implies the owner's right to include as well as to exclude others from his property.""

It's Putin's fault for not allowing the country to expand its economic base, unlike what happened in China. It isn't about economic integration, per se. But rather, it's the cultural trait of a people, and the autocratic nature of their government structure that allows both Russia and China to consolidate power in the hands of its strongmen leaders. THAT's what happened.",0.5439,Positive

This is a threat to democracy that is already today resulting in a global trend of autocratization of nations, because unlike what capitalism tacitly promises, the intrests of companies and the people who own them, do not allign with the interests of people in general.

To a company being run according to capitalistic principles, the needs and wants of people is something to be exploited for profit. Thus, it is profitable to create and maintain needs and wants in people, so that companies continue to have something to exploit. When a company then creates any product, it will by necessity be in some way designed to exploit our needs and wants, lest the company go bankrupt for having created a product that serves as a permanent solution to the problem it is designed to solve, and will no longer be needed to be bought from the company.

One example of this happening today is the high amount of food waste generated in many countries, because it is more profitable to overproduce as long as demand doesn't drop. Another is the amount of effort some companies put into planned and percieved obsolescence, to ensure their customers will need or want to buy their product again, because it is more profitable to sell more stuff. 

Capitalism runs on conflicts of interest, and the ability of those with the most capital to win those conflicts.",0.9178,Positive

@hungrymusicwolf,2023-06-14T18:17:34Z,"I think this is an incredibly important TED-talk. 

We should not rely on these powerful people being responsible, because power is passed from generation to generation and as with kings eventually it goes wrong. This needs to be regulated and proper institutions need to be build to competently do so. 

This is a new era and we should act like it. We need to all be ready to act on a moments notice and direct technology companies towards a better and more free future, instead of a tech dystopia. Otherwise just like we had the crazy hellhole after industrialization, we'll have an even worse hellhole today if we let this reign free. One we may not be able to protest our way out of, because our smartphones / other technologies and dependency on social media for personal connections will remove that option if we do not act early.",0.9213,Positive

@perrypereyra6671,2023-06-14T17:16:13Z,"Damn, I thought about this too. Capitalist with its pros also comes its cons, and we must accept these flaws.

When people talk about democracy, we always believe that no one should above or have power than anyone, hence we created a system where everything in civil world could not behave with absolute freedom, hence rules, regulations, etc. etc., an equal system, a civil society, but when everything in this democracy system start to take effect, Capitalist in our free market society actively makes it clear that ""no no no, I do whatever I want"" and somehow this aspect of society needs to be excluded from our democracy as system as a whole. there's no commoner involved whatsoever, only those who gave job. And that is not sound very 'democratic' isn't it?

Now, there's no king and kingdoms where people could go to war for their soul, country, and beloved monarch. Even when there's country, there's now less honor among those who run our countries of the world. But now, we have faceless power, the one who benefitted and rose from the Capitalist system, who effectively have more power as this video and actual reality, the tech giant, the pharmaceutical company, the company who made tools for war.

We have government system and representative I repeat ""representative"" so that in our civil world we know who we can engage to talk. But when Capitalism and its child free roaming the world, we effectively erasing the face, hence why from the longest time we believe in conspiracy like Freemason and alike, a faceless entity. But in reality these faceless people are the one who ruling us all, not kings, not queens, not even president, not even dictator. No more title like totalitarian country or freedom country , but we all controlled by the company.


I don't actively oppose Capitatim, but instead to have open introspection to our system and its flaw that finally rear its heads out, that gave birth to these overpower company, I just believe in everything should come back to democracy, and also life long lesson from my parents that having to less food means starvation or too much food means vomit and pooping, both are equally bad. Hence why I sided with Iron Man in Captain America: Civil War, absolutely no one should left unchecked, yes people who enforce to 'check' could abuse their power, hence why we need to have system to time the power, and have open talk discussion.",0.6482,Positive
